<p><span class="smcap">The</span> aspect of the lonely moon in this bleak night
sky exerted a strange fascination upon the English
girl. She often paused to draw the improvised red
curtain at the tiny window of the log house that
served as the commandant’s quarters and gaze upon
the translucent sphere as it swung westering above
the spurs of the Great Smoky Mountains, which towered
in the icy air on the horizon. Beneath it the forests
gleamed fitfully with frost; the long snowy vistas
of the shadowy valleys showed variant tones of white
in its pearly lustre. So dominant was the sense of
isolation, of the infinite loneliness of the wilderness,
that to her the moon was like this nowhere else.
A suspended consciousness seemed to characterize it,
almost an abeyance of animation, yet this still serene
splendor did not suggest death. She had long ago
been taught, indeed, that it was an extinct and burnt-out
world. But in this strange new existence old
theories were blunted and she was ready for fresh
impressions. This majestic tranquillity seemed as of
deep and dreamless slumber, and the picturesque
fancy of the Indians that the moon is but the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
asleep took strong hold on her imagination. She
first heard the superstition one evening at dusk, as
she stood at the window with one end of the curtain
in her hand, and asked her father what was the word
for “moon” in the Cherokee language.</p>

<p>“Don’t know! The moon in English is bright
enough for me!” exclaimed Captain Howard, as he
sat in his easy-chair before the fire with his glass of
wine. A decanter was on the table beside him, and
with venison and wild-fowl for the solid business of
dinner, earlier in the afternoon, and chocolate-and-cocoanut
custard, concocted by his daughter, for the
“trifle,” he had fared well enough.</p>

<p>Very joyous he was in these days. The Seven
Years’ War was fairly over, the treaty of peace
concluded, and the surrender of the French forts on
the American frontier already imminent, even thus
early in the spring of 1763. His own difficult tour
of service, here at Fort Prince George, the British
stronghold on the eastern edge of the Cherokee
country, was nearing its close. He, himself, was to
be transferred to a post of ease and comfort at Charlestown,
where he would enjoy the benignities of social
courtesies and metropolitan association, and where
his family, who had come out from England for the
purpose, could join him for a time. Indeed, on his
recent return from South Carolina, where he had
spent a short leave of absence, he had brought thence
with him his eldest daughter, an intelligent girl of
eighteen years, who was opening great eyes at the
wonders of this new world, and who had specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
besought the privilege of a peep into the wilderness,
now that the frontier was quiet and safe.</p>

<p>George Mervyn, a captain-lieutenant of the garrison,
a youth whom her father greatly approved,—the
grandson of his nearest neighbor at home in Kent,
Sir George Mervyn,—was inclined to pose as a
picturesque incident himself of the frontier, the
soldier who had fought its battles and at last pacified
it. Now he suddenly developed unsuspected linguistic
accomplishments. He was tall, blond, and bland,
conventional of address, the model of decorous youth.
He seemed quiet, steady, trustworthy. His was evidently
the material of a valuable future. He rose
and joined her at the window.</p>

<p>“There is no more moon,” he said with a somewhat
affected but gentlemanly drawl. “You must realize
that, Miss Howard. This is ‘the sleeping sun,’
You must not expect to see the moon on the frontier.”</p>

<p>“Only a stray moonling, now and then,” another
subaltern struck in with a laugh.</p>

<p>There was something distinctly sub-acid in the
quick clear-clipped tones, and Captain Howard lifted
his head with a slightly corrugated brow. He
looked fixedly into his glass as if he discerned dregs
of bitterness lurking therein. He was experiencing
a sentiment of surprise and annoyance that had
earlier harassed him, to be dismissed as absurd;
but now, recurring, it seemed to have gathered
force. These two young men were friends of the
Damon-and-Pythias type. Their one-ness of heart
and unanimity of thought had been of infinite service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
to him in the many difficult details of his command
at Fort Prince George,—a flimsy earth-work
with a block-house or two, garrisoned by a mere
handful of troops, in a remote wilderness surrounded
by a strong and savage foe. These officers had been
zealous to smooth each other’s way; they had vied
to undertake onerous duties, to encounter danger, to
palliate short-comings. They were always companions
when off duty; they hunted and fished
together; they were on terms of intimate confidence,
even privileged to read each other’s letters. They
were sworn comrades, and yet to-day (Captain
Howard did not know how to account for it—he
was growing old, surely) neither had addressed a
kindly word to the other; nay, Ensign Raymond
was sharply and apparently intentionally sarcastic.</p>

<p>Captain Howard wondered that Arabella did not
notice it, but there she stood by the window, the
curtain in her hand, the light of the great flaring fire
on the hair, a little paler than gold, which she had
inherited from her Scotch mother, and the large,
sincere, hazel English eyes which were like Captain
Howard’s own. The delicate rose tint of her cheek
did not even fluctuate; she looked calmly at the
young men as they glared furiously at each other.
But for her presence Captain Howard would have
ordered them to their respective quarters to avoid a
collision. Fort Prince George was not usually the
scene of internecine strife. He resented the suggestion
as an indignity to himself. It impaired the
flavor of the dinner he had enjoyed, and jeopardized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
digestion. It was a disrespect to the formality with
which he had complimented the occasion of his
daughter’s arrival, inviting his old neighbor’s grandson,
with his especial friend, and wearing his powdered
wig, his punctilious dress uniform, pumps, and
silk hose. It had been long since his table was
graced by a woman arrayed ceremoniously for dinner,
and the sight of his daughter in her rose-hued
tabby gown, with shining arms and shoulders and a
string of pearls around her throat, was a pleasant
reminder to him, in this bleak exile, of the customs
of old times, soon to be renewed, the more appreciated
for compulsory disuse. Captain Howard, watching
the group as the young men glowered at each other,
was amazed to think that she looked as if she enjoyed
it, the image of demure placidity.</p>

<p>“The Cherokees call the moon <i>Neusse anantoge</i>, ‘the
sleeping sun,’” said the captain-lieutenant, making
no rejoinder to Raymond.</p>

<p>“La! How well you speak their language, Mr.
Mervyn, to be sure. Oh-h, how musical! As lovely
as Italian! Oh-h-h—how I wish I could learn it
before I go back to England! Sure, ’twould be
monstrous genteel to know Cherokee in London.
<i>Neusse anantoge.</i> I’ll remember that. ‘The sleeping
sun.’ I’ll say that again. <i>Neusse anantoge. Neusse
anantoge.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Neusse anantoge!</i>” cried Raymond, with a fleering
laugh. “Gad, Mervyn, you <i>are</i> moon-struck.”</p>

<p>His bright dark eyes were angry, although laughing.
They seemed to hold a light like coals of fire, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
all a-smoulder, and again vivid with caloric or
choler. With his florid complexion and dark hair
and eyes the powder had a decorative emphasis which
the appearance of neither of the other men attained.
The lace cravat about his throat was of fine texture
and delicately adjusted, but it was frayed along the
edge in more than one place and the lapels of his red
coat hardly concealed this. Woman-like she was
quick to discern the insignia of genteel poverty, and
she pitied him with a sympathy which she would not
have felt for a rent of the skin or a broken bone.
These were but the natural incidents of a soldier’s
life; blows and bruises must needs be cogeners. She
divined that his education and his commission were
all of value at his command,—the younger son of a
good family, but poor and proud,—and it was hard
to live in a world of lace and powder on so slender
an endowment. She began to hate the precise and
priggish George Mervyn who roused him so, although
the provocation came from Raymond, and she was
already wondering at her father that this dashing
man, who had a thousand appeals to a poetic imagination,
stood no higher in favor. She did not realize
that a long command at Fort Prince George was no
promoter of a poetic imagination.</p>

<p>As Raymond spoke Miss Howard turned eagerly
toward him, the dark red curtain still in her hand,
showing a section of the bleak, moonlit, wintry scene
in the distance, and in the foreground the stockaded
ramparts, the guard-house, its open door emitting an
orange-tinted flare of fire, the blue-and-black shadows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
lurking about the block-house and the hard-trodden
snow of the deserted parade.</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> say it should be, then?” she demanded
peremptorily, as if she were determined not
to be brought to confusion by venturing incorrect
Cherokee in London,—as if there a slip of the
tongue would be easily detected!</p>

<p>“How much Cherokee does <i>he</i> know?” interposed
Mervyn, satirically. “We keep an interpreter in constant
employ,—expressly for him.”</p>

<p>Raymond was spurred on to assert himself.</p>

<p>“<i>Neusse anantoge!</i>” he jeered. “Then what do
you make of <i>Nu-da-su-na-ye-hi</i>? That is ‘the sun
sleeping in the night.’ And see here, <i>Nu-da-ige-hi</i>.
That is ‘the sun living in the day.’”</p>

<p>“<i>That?</i>—why, that is the Lower town dialect.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Lower town dialect!” Raymond, in derision,
whirled about on the heels of his pumps, for
he too was displaying all the glory of silk hose. “The
Lower town dialect,—save the mark! It is Overhill
Cherokee.”</p>

<p>“Oh,—oh,—are there <i>two</i> dialects of the Cherokee
language?” cried Arabella. “How wonderful! And
of the different towns! Oh-h—which <i>are</i> the lower
towns? and oh,—Mr. Raymond, how prodigiously
clever to know both the dialects!”</p>

<p>Captain Howard lifted his head with a brusque
challenge in his eye. He tolerated none but national
quarrels. He did not understand the interests in
conflict. But he thought to end them summarily.
The words “moonling,” “moon-struck,” and the tone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
of the whole conversation were not conducive to the
conservation of the peace. Raymond had conducted
himself in a very surly and nettling manner all
through the day toward his quondam friend, who,
so far as Captain Howard could see, had given him
no cause of offence.</p>

<p>He was obviously about to strike into the conversation,
and all three faces turned toward him,
alert, expectant. The suave inscrutable countenance
of the young lady merely intimated attention, but it
was difficult for the two young men to doff readily
their half scoffing expressions of anger and defiance
and assume the facial indicia of respect and deference
and bland subservience due to their host,
their senior, and their superior officer.</p>

<p>His sister, however, quickly forestalled his acrid
comments. Mrs. Annandale ostensibly played the
part of duenna to her niece and of acquiescent chorus
to her brother’s dictatorial opinions. But in her
secret heart she controverted his every prelection, and
she countermarched his intentions with an unsuspected
skill that was the very climax of strategy, for
she brought him to the conviction that they were his
own plans she had furthered and his own orders she
had executed. Her outer aspect aided her designs—it
was marvellously incongruous with the character
of tactician. She had a scanty little visage, pale
and wrinkled, with small pursed-up lips, closely
drawn in meek assent, and small bright eyes that
twinkled timorously out from gray lashes. A modish
head-dress surmounted and concealed her thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
gray locks, and an elaborately embroidered kerchief,
crossed over the bosom of her puce-colored satin
gown, conforming in the décolleté cut to the universal
fashion of the day, hid the bones of her wasted
little figure. She was very prim, and mild, and
upright, as she sat in the primitive arm-chair,
wrought by the post-carpenter and covered with a
buffalo-skin. In a word she turned the trend of the
discourse.</p>

<p>“M—m—m,” she hesitated. “Sure, ’twould
seem one dialect might express all the ideas of the
Indians—they have a monstrous talent for silence.”</p>

<p>She looked directly at Raymond from out her
weak, blinking little eyes.</p>

<p>“They talk more among themselves, madam, and
when at home,” responded Raymond, turning away
from the young people at the window, and leaning
against the high mantel-piece, one hand on the shelf
as he stood on the opposite side of the fire from Mrs.
Annandale. “They are ill at ease here at the fort,—the
presence of the soldiers abashes and depresses
them; they are much embittered by their late
defeat.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale shuddered. She was afraid of
wind and lightning; of waters and ghosts; of signs
and omens; of savages and mice; of the dark and
of the woods; of gun-powder and a sword-blade.</p>

<p>“And are you not frightened of them, Mr. Raymond?”
she quavered.</p>

<p>He stared in amazement, and Captain Howard,
restored to good temper, cocked up his eyes humorously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
at the young soldier. The vivid red and
white of Raymond’s complexion, his powdered side-curls,
and his bold, bright hazel eyes, were heightened
by the delicacy of his lace cravat, and his red uniform
was brought out in fine effect by the flaring light of
the deep chimney-place, but Mrs. Annandale’s heart
was obdurate to all such appeals, even vicariously.
A side glance had shown her that the young people
at the window had drawn closer together and a low-toned
and earnest conversation was in progress
there,—the captain-lieutenant was talking fast and
eagerly, while the girl, holding the curtain, looked out
at the dreary wintry aspect of the sheeted wilderness,
the frontier fort, and the “sleeping sun” resting
softly in the pale azure sky, high, high above the
Great Smoky Mountains. The duenna pressed her
lips together in serene satisfaction.</p>

<p>“M—m—m. I should imagine you would be so
frightened of the Indians, Mr. Raymond,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ha—ha—ha—!” laughed Captain Howard,
outright.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale claimed no sense of humor, but
she was a very efficient mirth-maker, nevertheless.</p>

<p>“I am beholden to you, madam,” said the young
soldier, out of countenance. He could not vaunt
his courage in the presence of his commander, nor
would he admit fear even in fun. He was at a loss
for a moment.</p>

<p>“It is contrary to the rules of the service to be
afraid of the Indians,” he said after a pause; “Captain
Howard does not permit it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“Oh,—but how can anyone help it!—and
they are so monstrous ugly!”</p>

<p>“They are considered very fine men, physically,”
said Raymond.</p>

<p>“But they will never make soldiers,” interpolated
Captain Howard. The English government had done
its utmost with the American Indians, as with other
subdued peoples of its dependencies, both earlier and
later, to incorporate their martial strength into the
British armies, but the aborigines seemed incapable
of being moulded by the discipline of the drill and
the regulations of the camp, and deserted as readily
as they were enlisted, rewards and penalties alike of
no effect.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Raymond, no one could think them
handsome!—they are—greasy!”</p>

<p>“The grease is to afford a surface for their paint,
you must understand. But it is a horribly unclean
and savage custom.”</p>

<p>He never could account for a shade of offence on
the lady’s expressionless, limited face and a flush
other than that of the rouge on her delicate, little
flabby cheek. How should he know that that embellishment
was laid on a gentle coating of pomade
after the decrees of fashion. He was not versed in
the methods of cosmetics. He had been on the
frontier for the last three years—since his boyhood,
in fact, and that grace and gentlemanliness which so
commended his address were rather the results of
early training and tradition than the influence of association
with cultured circles of society. He knew that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
he had said something much amiss and he chafed at
the realization.</p>

<p>“I am fitter for an atmosphere of gun-powder than
attar of roses,” he said to himself with a half glance
over his shoulder at the window, the pale moonlight
making the face of the girl poetic, ethereal, and
shimmering on her golden hair.</p>

<p>The next moment, however, Mrs. Annandale
claimed his attention, annulling the idea that there
had been aught displeasing in his remark.</p>

<p>“But sure, Mr. Raymond, there were never towns,
called towns, such as theirs—la!—what a disappointment,
to be sure!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” exclaimed Captain Howard,
mightily amused. “So you are looking for the like
of Bond Street and Charing Cross and the Strand—eh!—in
Estatoe, and Kulsage, and Seneca,—ha!
ha! ha!”</p>

<p>Raymond winced a trifle lest the fragile little lady
should find this soldier-like pleasantry too bluff for
a sensitive nature, but she laughed with a subdued,
deprecating suggestion of merriment. He could not
imagine, as she lent herself to this ridicule, that she
construed it as humoring the folly of the commandant,
of whom indeed she always spoke behind his
back in a commiserating way as “poor dear Brother.”
She had so often outwitted the tough old soldier that
she looked upon his prowess as a vain thing, his
fierce encounters with the national foe mere figments
of war compared with those subtle campaigns in which
she so invariably worsted him. She laughed at herself.
She could afford it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Dear Brother,” she said, “Charlestown is not
London, to be sure, but we found it vastly genteel
for its size. There is everything a person of taste
requires for life—on a scale, to be sure—on a
minute scale. But there is a theatre, and a library
of books, so learning is not neglected, and a race-course,
and a society of tone. Lord, sir, strangers,
well introduced, have nothing to complain of. I’m
sure Arabella and I were taken about till we could
have dropped with fatigue, Mr. Raymond—what
with Whisk and Piquet for me and a minuet for her,
night after night, everywhere we went, we might
well have thought ourselves in London. And Lord,
sir, the British officers there are so content they
seem to think they have achieved Paradise.”</p>

<p>“I’ll warrant ’em,” and Captain Howard wagged
his head scoffingly, meditating on the contrast with
his past hardships in the frontier service.</p>

<p>“And being mightily charmed with what I had
seen of the province I was struck with a cold chill
by the time I’d crossed Ashley Ferry—the woods
half dark by day and a cavern by night; and such
howlings of owls, and lions, and tigers, I presume—”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho—ho—ho!” exclaimed Captain Howard.
“I’ll detail you, Ensign Raymond, to drill the awkward
squad in natural history.”</p>

<p>Raymond, responsive to the spirit of the jest,
stood at attention and saluted, as if receiving a
serious assignment to duty.</p>

<p>He was not of a wily nature, nor especially suspicious.
He had keen perceptions, however, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
own straightforward candor aided them in detecting
a circuitous divergence from the facts; when Mrs.
Annandale declared herself so terrified that she had
begged and prayed her niece and her brother to turn
back, he realized dimly that this was not the case,
that it was by her own free will the party had kept
on, and that Arabella would never have had the
cruelty to persist in the undertaking against her
aunt’s desire, nor had she the authority to compass
this decision. But why had the little woman mustered
the determination, he marvelled, for this long
and arduous journey. He looked at her with the
sort of doubtful and pitying yet fearful repulsion with
which a scientist might study a new and very eccentric
species of insect. He could realize that she had
suffered all the fright and fatigue she described.
Her puny little physique was indeed inadequate to
sustain so severe a strain, bodily and mentally.
Her fastidious distaste to the sight and customs of
the Indians was itself a species of pain. Why had
she come?</p>

<p>“Before we reached Ninety-Six I saw the first of
the savages. Oh,—Mr. Raymond,—it seems a
sort of indecency in the government to make war on
people who wear so few clothes. They ought to be
allowed to peacefully retire to the woods.”</p>

<p>“Oh—ho—ho—ho!—that’s the first time I
ever heard the propriety of the government called in
question,” said Captain Howard. He glanced over
his shoulder to make sure that Arabella had not overheard
this jest of doubtful grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“She’s busy,” Mrs. Annandale reassured him with
a sort of smirk of satisfaction, which impressed Raymond
singularly unpleasantly. He too glanced over
his shoulder. The tall, fair, graceful young officer
could hardly appear to greater advantage than
Mervyn did at this moment, in the blended light of
the fire and the moon, for the candles on the table
scarcely sent their beams so far. The rich dress of
the girl was accented and embellished by the simplicity
of the surroundings. Her head was turned
aside—only the straight and perfect lines of her
profile showed against the lustrous square of the
window. She still held the curtain and, while he
talked, she silently listened and gazed dreamily at
the moon. There was a moment of embarrassment
in the group at the fireside, as they relinquished
their covert scrutiny, and Raymond’s ready tact
sought the rescue of the situation.</p>

<p>“It has been urged that we armed the Indians
against ourselves through the trade in peace,” he
suggested.</p>

<p>“And now Mrs. Annandale thinks they ought to be
put in the pink of the fashion before being shot at—ha—ha—ha!”
returned Captain Howard.</p>

<p>“Then their towns,—a-lack-a-day,—to call them
towns! A cluster of huts and wigwams, and a mound,
and a rotunda, and a play-yard. They frightened
me into fits with their proffers of hospitality. The
women—dressed in some vastly fine furs and with
their hair plaited with feathers—came up to our
horses and offered us bread and fruit; oh, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
kind of boiled meal and water; and Arabella partook
and said it was nice and clean but I pressed my
hands to my stomach and rolled up my eyes to intimate
that I was ill; and indeed I was at the very
sight of them,” Mrs. Annandale protested.</p>

<p>Once more she glanced over her shoulder, thinking
her niece might hear her name; again that smirk of
satisfaction to note the mutual absorption of the two,
then, lest the pause seem an interruption, she went on:</p>

<p>“And have these wretches two sets of such towns?
lower and upper—filthy abominations!”</p>

<p>“No, no, Claudia,” said the captain, shaking his
head, “they are clean, they are clean—clean as
floods of pure water can make them. Every town
is on a rock-bound water-course, finest, freshest,
freest streams in the world, and every Indian, big
and little, goes under as a religious duty every day.
No, they are clean.”</p>

<p>“Dear heart!” exclaimed the lady, without either
contention or acquiescence.</p>

<p>“And they wear ample clothes, too. The buck-skin
hunting-shirt and leggings of our frontiersmen
are copied from the attire of the Indians. If
you saw savages who were scantily clothed they must
have been very poor, or on the war-path against
other Indians—for they wear clothes, as they construe
them, on ordinary occasions.”</p>

<p>“How nice of them,” commented Mrs. Annandale.
“Shows their goodness of heart.”</p>

<p>Once more Raymond bent the gaze of an inquiring
scrutiny upon the lady—simple as she was, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
not yet classified her. She had begun to exert a
sort of morbid fascination upon him. He did not
understand her, and the enigma held him relentlessly.</p>

<p>He had not observed a motion which Arabella had
made once or twice to quit the <i>tête-à-tête</i> beside the
window, and he was taken by surprise when she
suddenly approached the fire. Standing, tall and
slender and smiling, between him and her father,
with her hand on the commandant’s chair, she addressed
the coterie at large:—</p>

<p>“What a jovial time you seem to be having!”</p>

<p>Raymond’s heart plunged, and Mervyn reddened
slightly with an annoyance otherwise sedulously repressed.
She spoke with a naïve suggestion as of
an enforced exclusion from the fun. “What is all
this talk about?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Raymond has been admiring the Indians’
taste in dress,” said Mrs. Annandale, titteringly,—“he
says they wear the hides of beasts,—their own hides.”</p>

<p>Captain Howard frowned. It did not enter into
his scheme of things to question the discretion of a
professed duenna. He was confused for a moment,
and it seemed to him that the fault lay in Raymond’s
bad taste in the remark rather than in its repetition.
It did not occur to him that it was made for the first
time.</p>

<p>Raymond, realizing that for some reason Mrs.
Annandale sought to place him at a disadvantage,
was on the point of gasping out a denial, but the
gaucherie of contradicting a lady, and she the
sister of his host, deterred him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Though the young girl was convent-bred with
great seclusion and care, she had emerged into an
atmosphere of such sophistication that she was able
to seem to have apprehended naught amiss. She
bent her eyes with quiet attention on her aunt’s
face when Mrs. Annandale said abruptly:—</p>

<p>“Tell George Mervyn how oddly those gypsies were
dressed—gypsies, or Hindoos, or whatever they were—that
camped down on the edge of the copse close
to his grandfather’s park gates last fall, and told
your fortune!”</p>

<p>“Was it on our side of the ha-ha, or your side?”
asked Mervyn, eagerly. For as Raymond understood
the property of the two families adjoined, large and
manorial possessions on the part of the Mervyns, and
with their neighbors a very modest holding—a good
old house but with little land.</p>

<p>“Oh, to think of the copse!” cried Mervyn with a
gush of homesick feeling,—“to think of the beck!
I could almost die to be a boy again for one hour,
bird-nesting there once more!”</p>

<p>“Even if I made you put the eggs back?” Arabella
smiled.</p>

<p>“Though they would never hatch after being
touched,” he corroborated.</p>

<p>“But tell the story, Arabella. Tell what the
gypsy said,” urged Mrs. Annandale, significantly.</p>

<p>The young lady still stood, her hand resting on
her father’s chair. She looked down into the fire
with inscrutable hazel eyes. Her face seemed to
glow and pale, as the flames flared and fell and sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
pulsations of shoaling light along the glistening
waves of her pink tabby gown.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what the gypsy said,” she returned.</p>

<p>“But you cared then—enough to cross her hand
with silver!” cried Mrs. Annandale. “And, George,
your grandfather, Sir George, came riding by—I
think that gray cob is a rather free goer for the old
gentleman—and he reined up by the hedge and
looked over. And he said, ‘Make it gold, young lady,
if you want it rich and true. Buy your luck—that’s
the way to get it!’”</p>

<p>Captain Howard stirred uneasily. “Sir George is
right—the gypsy hussy is bought; she gives a
shilling fortune for a shilling and a crown of luck
for a crown. I have no faith in the practice.”</p>

<p>“You will when you hear this, dear Brother.
Tell what the gypsy said, Arabella!” Mrs. Annandale
leaned forward with her small mouth tightly
closed and her small eyes twinkling with expectation.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have clean forgot,” declared Arabella, her
eyes still on the coals and standing in the rich illumination
of the flare.</p>

<p>“I have not forgot. I heard every word!” exclaimed
the wily tactician.</p>

<p>Now Arabella lifted her long dark lashes, and it
seemed to Raymond that she sent a glance of pleading
expostulation, of sensitive appeal to meet the
microscopic glitter in the pinched and wizened pale
face. Mervyn waited in a quiver of expectation, of
suspense; and Raymond, wounded, excluded, set at
naught, as he had felt, was sensible of a quickening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
of his pulses. But why did the old woman
persist?</p>

<p>“There is nothing in such prophecies,” said Captain
Howard, uneasily.</p>

<p>“She said you had a lover over seas,—didn’t she,
my own?”</p>

<p>The girl, looking again at the red fire, nodded her
golden head casually, as if in renewing memory.</p>

<p>“One who loved you, and whom you loved!”</p>

<p>Mervyn caught his breath. The blood had flared
into his face. He held himself tense and erect by
a sheer effort of will, but any moment he might
collapse into a nervous tremor.</p>

<p>“She said—oh, she said—” exclaimed Mrs.
Annandale, prolonging the suspense of the moment
and clasping her mittened hands about her knees,
leaning forward and looking into the fire, “she said
he was handsome, and tall, and blond. And you—you
didn’t know in the least who he was; though
you gave her another crown from pure good will!”
And Mrs. Annandale tittered teasingly and archly,
as she glanced at Mervyn.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I did know who he was,”—the girl
electrified the circle by declaring. “That is why I
gave her more money.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were wide and bright. She tossed her
head with a knowing air. Her cheeks were scarlet,
and the breath came fast over her parted red lips.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale sat in motionless consternation.
She had lost the helm of the conversation and it
seemed driving at random through a turmoil of chopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
chances. Mervyn looked hardly less frightened,—as
if he might faint,—for he felt that his name
was trembling on Arabella’s lips. It was like the
chaos of some wild unexplained dream when she
suddenly resumed:—</p>

<p>“The gypsy meant Monsieur Delorme, my drawing-master
at Dijon—all the pupils were in love with
him—I, more than all—handsome and adorable!”</p>

<p>Raymond’s eyes suddenly met Mervyn’s stony stare
of amazement. He did not laugh, but that gay,
bantering, comprehending look of joyful relish had
as nettling a sting as a roar of bravos.</p>

<p>Captain Howard was but just rescued from a
dilemma that had bidden fair to whelm all his
faculties, but his disgust recovered him.</p>

<p>“Oh, fie!”—he said rancorously. “The drawing-master!
Fudge!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale had the rare merit of knowing
when she was defeated. She had caused her brother
to invite Raymond merely that the invitation to
Mervyn might not seem too particular. But having
this point secure she had given him not one thought
and not a word save to engage his attention and
permit Mervyn’s <i>tête-à-tête</i> with her niece. Since
her little scheme of bantering the two lovers, as she
desired to consider them, or rather to have them consider
each other, had gone so much awry, she addressed
herself to obliterate the impression it had made. She
now sought to ply Raymond with her fascinations,
and with such effect that Mervyn, who had been
occupied with plans to get himself away so that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
might consider in quiet the meaning of her demonstration
and the girl’s unexpected rejoinder, was amazed
and dismayed. Mrs. Annandale was of stancher stuff
than he thought, and though afterward she much
condemned the result of her inquiries touching family
relations and mutual acquaintance in England, this
seemed to be the only live topic between a young man
and an elderly woman such as she, specially shaken
as she had been by the downfall of all her plans in the
manipulation of the treacherous Arabella. She had
not, indeed, intended to elicit the fact that Raymond
was nearly connected with some of the best people
in the kingdom, that his family was so old and of
so high a repute that a modern baronetcy was really
a thing of tinsel and mean pretence in comparison.
Among them there was no wealth of note, but deeds
of distinction decorated almost every branch of the
family tree. When at last she could bear no more
and rose, admonishing her niece to accompany her,
terminating the entertainment, as being themselves
guests, Arabella, sitting listening by the side of the
fire, thrown back in the depths of the arm-chair
among the furs that covered it, exclaimed naively:
“What! So early!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mrs. Annandale and her niece repaired to
the quarters assigned them, the young lady passed
through the room of the elder to the inner apartment,
as if she feared that her contumacy might be
upbraided. But if Mrs. Annandale felt her armor
a burden and was a-wearied with the untoward result
of the evening’s campaign she made no sign, but
gallantly persevered, realizing the truism that more
skill is requisite in conducting a retreat than in
leading the most spirited assault. She followed her
niece and seated herself by the fire while Arabella
at the dressing-table let down her mass of golden
hair and began to ply the brush, looking meanwhile
at a very disaffected face in the mirror. The
youthful maid who officiated for both ladies, monopolized
chiefly by Mrs. Annandale, was busied with
some duties touching a warming-pan in the outer
room, and thus the opportunity for confidential conversation
was ample.</p>

<p>“These soldiers talk so much about their hard
case,” said the elder lady, looking about her with an
appraising eye. “Many folks at home might call this
luxury.”</p>

<p>For Captain Howard had exerted his capacity and
knowledge to the utmost to compass comfort for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
sister and daughter, with the result that he was held
to complain without a grievance. A great fire roared
in a deep chimney-place—there were no andirons,
it is true, but two large dornicks served as well.
The log walls were white-washed and glittered with
a vaunt of cleanliness. The bed-curtains were pink,
and fluttered in a draught from the fire. Rose-tinted
curtains veiled the meagre sashes of the glazed
windows. The chairs, of the clumsy post manufacture,
were big and covered with dressed furs.
Buffalo rugs lay before the wide hearth and on the
floor. A candle flickered unneeded on the white-draped
dressing-table, and there was the glitter of
silver and glass and of such <i>bijouterie</i> as dressing-case
and jewel-box could send forth. The young girl,
now in a pink <i>robe de chambre</i>, seemed in accord with
the rude harmony of the place.</p>

<p>“They line their nests right well, these tough
soldiers,” said the elder woman. “If it were not for
the Indians, and the marching, and the guns, and the
noisy powder, and the wild-cats, and the wilderness,
one might marry a soldier with a fair prospect.
George Mervyn is a handsome young man, Bella.”</p>

<p>“He looks like a sheep,” said Arabella, petulantly.
“That long, thin, mild face of his, pale as the powder
on his hair, without a spark of spirit, and those stiff
side-curls on each side of his head, exactly like a
ram’s horns! He looks like a sheep, and he <i>is</i> a
sheep.”</p>

<p>With all her unrevealed and secret purposes it was
difficult to hold both temper and patience after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
strain of the mishaps of the evening. But Mrs.
Annandale merely yawned and replied, “I think he
is a handsome young man, and much like Sir George.”</p>

<p>“Ba-a-a!—Ba-a-a!”—said the dutiful niece.</p>

<p>The weary little woman still held stanchly on.
“I believe you’d rather marry the grandfather.”</p>

<p>“I would—but I don’t choose to marry either.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale had a sudden inspiration. “No,
my poor love,” she said with a downward inflection,
“a girl like you, with beauty, and brains, and good
birth, and fine breeding,—but no money, too often
doesn’t <i>choose</i> to marry anybody, for anybody that
<i>is</i> anybody doesn’t want her.”</p>

<p>There was dead silence in front of the mirror.
A troublous shade settled on the fair face reflected
therein. The brush was motionless. An obvious dismay
was expressed in the pause. Self-pity is a
poignant pain.</p>

<p>“Lord! Lord!—how unevenly the good things
of this world are divided,” sighed the philosopher.
“The daughter of a poor soldier, and it makes no
difference how lovely, how accomplished!—while if
you were the bride of Sir George Mervyn’s grandson—bless
me, girl, your charms would be on every
tongue. You’d be the toast of all England!”</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence while the light
flashed from the lengths of golden hair as the brush
went back and forth with strong, quick strokes.
The head, intently poised, betokened a sedulous
attention.</p>

<p>“Out upon the injustice of it!” cried Mrs. Annandale,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
with unaffected fervor. “To be beautiful, and
well-bred, and well-born, and well-taught, and faultless,
and capable of gracing the very highest station
in the land, and to be driven by poverty to take a
poor, meagre, contemned portion in life, simply and
solely because those whom you are fit for, and who
are fit for you, will not condescend to think of
you.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that!” cried Arabella, suddenly,
with a tense note of elation. The mirror
showed the vivid flush rising in her cheeks, the
spirit in her eyes, the pride in the pose of her head.
“And, Aunt, mark you now,—no man can <i>condescend</i>
to me!”</p>

<p>“Lord! you poor child, how little you know of
the ways of the world. But they were not in the
convent course, I warrant you. Wealth marries
wealth. Station climbs to higher station. Gallantry,
admiration, all that is very well in a way, to pass the
time. But men’s wounded hearts are easily patched
with title-deeds and long rent-rolls. Don’t let your
pride make you think that your bright eyes can
shine like the Golightly diamonds. Bless my soul,
Miss Eva had them all on at the county ball
last year. Ha! ha! ha! I remember Sir George
Mervyn said she looked a walking pawn-shop,—they
were so prodigiously various. You know the
Mervyns always showed very chaste taste in the
matter of jewellery—the family jewels are few, but
monstrous fine; every stone is a small fortune. But
he was vastly polite to her at supper. I thought I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
would warn you, sweet, don’t bother to be civil to
young George, for old Sir George is determined on
that match. Though the money was made in trade
’twas a long time ago, and there’s a mort of it. The
girl has a dashing way with her, too, and sets up
for a beauty when <i>you</i> are out of the county.”</p>

<p>“Lord, ma’am, Eva Golightly?” questioned Arabella,
in scornful amaze.</p>

<p>“Sure, she has fine dark eyes, and she can make
them flash and play equal to the diamonds in her
hair. Maybe I’m as dazzled as the men, but she
fairly looked like a princess to me. Heigho! has
that besom ever finished fixing my bed? Good
night—good night—my poor precious—and—say
your prayers, child, say your prayers!”</p>

<p>The face in the mirror—the brush was still again—showed
a depression of spirit, but the set teeth
and an intimation of determination squared its
delicate chin till Arabella looked like Captain Howard
in the moment of ordering a desperate assault on the
enemy’s position. There was, nevertheless, a sort of
flinching, as of a wound received, sensitive in a thousand
keen appreciations of pain. The word “condescend”
had opened her eyes to new interpretations
of life. Her father might realize that a captain, however
valorous, did not outrank a major-general, but
in the splendor of her young beauty, and cultured
intelligence, and indomitable spirit, she had felt a
regal preëminence, and the world accorded her
homage. That it was a mere <i>façon de parler</i> had
never before occurred to her—a sort of cheap indulgence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
to a pretension without solid foundation.
Her pride was cut to the quick. She was considered,
forsooth, very pretty, and vastly accomplished, and
almost learned with her linguistic acquirements and
the mastery of heavy tomes of dull convent lore, yet
of no sort of account because her people were not
rich and she had no dowry, and unless she should be
smitten by some stroke of good fortune, as uncontrollable
as a bolt of lightning, she was destined
to mate with some starveling curate or led captain,
when as so humbly placed a dame she would lack the
welcome in the circles that had once flattered her
beauty and her transient belleship. The candle on
the dressing-table was guttering in its socket when
its fitful flaring roused her to contemplate the pallid
reflection, all out of countenance, the fire dwindling
to embers, and the shadows that had crept into the
retired spaces of the bed, between the rose-tinted
curtains, with a simulacrum of dull thoughts for the
pillow and dreary dreams.</p>

<p>The interval had not passed so quietly within the
precincts of Mrs. Annandale’s chamber. The connecting
door was closed, and Arabella did not notice
the clamor, as the maid was constrained to try the
latches of the outer door and adjust and readjust
the bars, and finally to push by main force and a
tremendous clatter one of the great chairs against it,
lest some discerning and fastidious marauder should
select out of all Fort Prince George, Mrs. Annandale’s
precious personality to capture, or “captivate,”
to use the incongruous and archaic phrase of the day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Now that the outer door was barricaded beyond all
possibility of being carried by storm or of surreptitious
entrance, Mrs. Annandale was beset with anxiety
as to egress on an emergency.</p>

<p>“But look, you hussy,” she exclaimed, as she
stood holding the candle aloft to light the tusslings
and tuggings of the maid with the furniture and the
bar, “suppose the place should take fire. How am
I to get out! You have shut me in here to perish
like a rat in a trap, you heartless jade!”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure, mem, the fort will never take fire—the
captain is that careful—the foine man he is!”
said the girl, turning up her fresh, rosy, Irish face.</p>

<p>“I know the ‘foine man’ better than you do,”
snapped her mistress. The victory of the evening
had been so long deferred, so hardly won at last,
that the conqueror was in little better case than the
defeated; she was fit to fall with fatigue, and her
patience was in tatters. The War Office intrusted
Captain Howard with the lives of its stanch soldiers
and the value of many pounds sterling in munitions
of war. But his sister belittled the enemy she had
so often worsted, and who never even knew that he
was beaten. “And those zanies of soldiers—smoking
their vile tobacco like Indians!”</p>

<p>“Lord, mem,” said the girl, still on her knees,
vigorously chunking and jobbing at the door, “the
sojers are in barracks, in bed and asleep these three
hours agone.”</p>

<p>“Look at that guard-house, flaring like the gates
of hell! What do you mean by lying, girl!” Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Annandale glanced out of the white curtained window,
showing a spark of light in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Sure, ma’am, it’s the watch they be kapin’ so
kindly all night, like the stars, or the blissed saints
in heaven!”</p>

<p>“Mightily like the ‘blissed saints in heaven,’ I’ll
wager,” said the old lady, sourly.</p>

<p>“I was fair afeard o’ Injuns and wild-cats till I
seen the gyard turn out, mem,” said the maid,
relishing a bit of gossip.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale gave a sudden little yowl, not unlike
a feline utterance.</p>

<p>“You Jezebel,” she cried in wrath, “what did you
remind me of them for—look behind the curtains—under
the valance of the bed—yow!—there is
no telling who is hid there—robbers, murderers!”</p>

<p>Norah, young, plump, neat, and docile to the
last degree, sprang up from her knees and rushed
at these white dimity fabrics, tossing their fringed
edges, with a speed and spirit that might have implied
a courage equal to the encounter with concealed
braves or beasts. But too often had she had this
experience, finding nothing to warrant a fear. It
was a mere form of search in her estimation, and
her ardor was assumed to give her mistress assurance
of her efficiency and protection. Therefore, when on
her knees by the bedside she sprang back with a
sudden cry of genuine alarm, her unexpected terror
out-mastered her, and she fled whimpering to the
other side of the room behind the little lady, who,
dropping the candle in amazement and a convulsive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
tremor, might have achieved the conflagration she
had prefigured without the aid of the zanies of the
barracks, but that the flame failed in falling.</p>

<p>“Boots!—Boots!—” cried the girl, her teeth
chattering.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale’s courage seemed destined to unnumbered
strains. It was not her will to exert it.
She preferred panic as her prerogative. She glanced
at the door, barred by her own precautions against
all possibility of a speedy summons for help. Even
to hail the guard-house through the window was
futile at the distance; to escape by way of the casement
was impossible, the rooms being situated in the
second story of the large square building; a moment
of listening told her that her niece was all unaware
of the crisis, asleep, perhaps, silent, still. There
was nothing for it but her own prowess.</p>

<p>“I have a blunderbuss here, man,” she said,
seizing the curling-iron from her dressing-table and
marking with satisfaction the long and formidable
shadow it cast in the firelight on the white wall.
“Bring those boots out or I’ll shoot them off you!”</p>

<p>There was dead silence. She heard the fire crackle,
the ash stir, even, she fancied, the tread of a sentry
in the tower above the gate.</p>

<p>“It’s a Injun—a Injun—he don’t understand
the spache, mem!” said Norah, wondering that the
unknown had the temerity to disregard this august
summons.</p>

<p>“Norah,” said Mrs. Annandale, autocratically, and
as she flourished the curling-tongs Norah cowered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
and winced as from a veritable blunderbuss, so did
the little lady dominate by her asseverations the
mind of her dependent—and indeed stancher mental
endowments than poor little Norah’s—“fetch me
out those boots.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mem—what am I to do with the man that’s
in ’em?” quavered the Abigail, dolorously.</p>

<p>“Fetch him, too, if he’s there. Give him a tug,
I say, girl.”</p>

<p>The doubt that this mandate expressed, nerved
the timorous maid to approach the silent white-draped
bed. That she had nevertheless expected
both resistance and weight was manifest in the degree
of strength she exerted. She fell back, overthrown by
the sheer force of the recoil, with a large empty boot
in her hand, nor would she believe that the miscreant
had not craftily slipped off the footgear till the other
came as empty, and a timorous peep ascertained that
there were no feet to match within view.</p>

<p>“Some officer’s boots!” soliloquized Mrs. Annandale.
“He must have left them here when he was
turned out of these snug quarters to make room for
us. I wonder when that floor was swept.”</p>

<p>“Sure, mem, they’re not dusty,” said Norah, all
blithe and rosy once more. “I’m rej’iced that he
wasn’t in ’em.”</p>

<p>“Who—the officer?” with a withering stare.</p>

<p>“No’m, the Injun I was looking for”—with a
quaver.</p>

<p>“Or the wild-cat you was talking about! Nasty
things! Never mention them again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>Mrs. Annandale was a good deal shaken by the
experience and tottered slightly as she paused at the
dressing-table and laid down the curling-tongs that
had masqueraded as a blunderbuss. The maid, all
smiling alacrity to make amends, bustled cheerily
about in the preparations for the retirement of
her employer. “Sure, mem, yez would love to see
’em dead.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a tongue now, but some day it will
be cut out,” the old woman remarked, acridly.</p>

<p>“I’m maning to say, mem, they have the beautifulest
fur—them wild-cats, not the Injuns. There’s
a robe or blanket av ’em in the orderly room—beautiful,
mem, sure, like the cats may have in
heaven.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Annandale sat in her great chair she
seemed to be falling to pieces, so much of her identity
came off as her hand-maiden removed her
effects. She was severally divested of her embroidered
cape, the full folds of her puce-colored
satin gown, her slippers and clocked stockings;
and when at last in her night-rail and white night-cap,
she looked like a curious antique infant, with
a malignant and coercive stare. Norah handled
her with a fearful tenderness, as if she might break
in two, such a wisp of a woman she was! Little like
a conquering hero she seemed as she sat there before
the fire, now girding at the offices of her attendant,
now whimpering weakly, like a spoiled child, her
white-capped head nodding and her white-clad figure
fairly lost in the great chair, but she was the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
puissant force that had ever invested Fort Prince
George, though it had sustained both French military
strategy and Indian savage wiles. And the days to
come were to bear testimony to her courage, her
address, and her dominant rage for power. When
her little fateful presence was eclipsed at last by the
ample white bed-curtains and Norah was free to
draw forth her pallet and lay herself down on the
floor before the fire, the girl could not refrain a long-drawn
sigh, half of fatigue and half self-commiseration.
It seemed a hard lot with her exacting and
freakish employer. But the cold bitter wind came
surging around the corner of the house, and she
remembered the bleak morasses across the wild
Atlantic, the little smoky hovel she called home,
the many to fend from frost and famine, the close
and crowded quarters, the straw bed where she had
lain, neighboring the pig. She thought of her august
room-mate in comparison.</p>

<p>“But faix!—how much perliter was the crayther
to be sure!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was one of the peculiarities of the officers of
the Fort Prince George garrison that they were
subject to fits of invisibility, Mrs. Annandale declared.
She had been taciturn, even inattentive, over
her dish of chocolate at early breakfast. More than
once she turned, with a frostily fascinating smile,
beamingly expectant, as the door opened. But when
the dishes were removed, and the breakfast-room
resumed its aspect as parlor, and her niece sat down
to her embroidery-frame as if she had been at home
in a country house in Kent, and the captain rose and
began to get into his outdoor gear, Mrs. Annandale’s
sugared and expectant pose gave way to blunt disappointment.</p>

<p>“Where are those villains we wasted our good
cheer upon overnight?” she brusquely demanded.
“I vow I expected to find them bowing their morning
compliments on the door-step!”</p>

<p>“You must make allowances for our rude frontier
soldiers,”—the commandant began.</p>

<p>“Were they caught up into the sky or swallowed
up by the earth?”</p>

<p>The commandant explained that the tours of service
recurred with unwelcome frequency in a garrison
so scantily officered as Fort Prince George, and that
Mervyn and Raymond were both on duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“You should have excused them, dear Brother,
since they are our acquaintances, and let some of
those rowdy fellows in the mess-hall march, or goose-step,
or deploy, or what not, in their stead.”</p>

<p>“Shoot me—no—no!” said the commandant,
wagging his head, for this touched his official conscience,
and the citadel in which it was ensconced
not even this wily strategist could reach. “No, no,
each man performs his own duty as it falls to him.
I would not exchange or permit an exchange to—to,
no, not to be quit forever of Fort Prince George.”</p>

<p>“Poor Arabella—she looks pale.”</p>

<p>“For neither of them,” the niece spoke up, tartly.</p>

<p>“Now that’s hearty,” said her father, approvingly.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to be quiet a bit, and rest from
the journey,” Arabella declared. “I don’t need to
be amused to-day.”</p>

<p>“Lord—Lord! I pray I may survive it,” her
aunt plained.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale was so definitely disconsolate and
indignant that the captain held a parley. Lieutenant
Bolt, the fort-adjutant, was a man of good
station, he said, and also a younger lieutenant and
two ensigns; should he not bespeak their company
for a game of Quadrille in his quarters this evening?</p>

<p>Truly “dear Brother” was too tediously dense. “A
murrain on them all!” she exclaimed angrily.
“What are they in comparison with young Mervyn?”</p>

<p>“As good men every way. Trained, tried, valuable
officers—worth their weight in gold,” he retorted,
aglow with <i>esprit de corps</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>She caught herself up sharply, fearing that she was
too outspoken; and, realizing that “dear Brother”
was an uncontrollable roadster when once he took
the bit between his teeth, she qualified hastily. “An
old woman loves gossip, Brother. What are these
strangers to me? George Mervyn and I will put
our heads together and canvass every scandal in the
county for the last five years. Lord, he knows every
stock and stone of the whole country-side, and all
the folks, gentle and simple, from castle to cottage.
I looked for some clavers such as old neighbors love.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of time—plenty of time,”—said the
commandant. “George Mervyn will last till to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow—is he in your clutches till to-morrow
morning?” the schemer shrieked in dismay.</p>

<p>“He is officer of the day, Claudia, and his tour of
duty began at guard-mounting this morning, and will
not be concluded till guard-mounting to-morrow
morning,” the captain said severely. Then in self-justification,
for he was a lenient man, except in his
official capacity, he added gravely: “You must
reflect, Sister, that though we are a small force in a
little mud fort on the far frontier, we cannot afford
to be triflers at soldiering. A better fort than ours
was compelled to surrender and a better garrison
was massacred not one hundred and fifty miles from
here. Our duties are insistent and our mutual responsibility
is great. We are intrusted with the lives
of each other.”</p>

<p>He desired these words to be of a permanent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
serious impression. He said no more and went out,
leaving Mrs. Annandale fallen back in her chair, holding
up her hands to heaven as a testimony against
him.</p>

<p>“Oh, the ruffian!” she gasped. “Oh—to remind
me of the Indians—the greasy, gawky red-sticks!
Oh, the blood-thirsty, truculent brother!”</p>

<p>Arabella was of a pensive pose, with her head bent
to her embroidery-frame, her trailing garment, called
a sacque, of dark murrey-colored wool, catching higher
wine-tinted lights from the fire as the folds opened
over a bodice and petticoat of flowered stuff of
acanthus leaves on a faint blue ground. She seemed
ill at ease under this rodomontade against her father,
and roused herself to protest.</p>

<p>“Why, you can’t have <i>forgotten</i> the Indians! You
were talking about them every step of the way from
Charlestown. And if you have seen one you have
seen one hundred.”</p>

<p>“Out of sight out of mind—and <i>me</i>—so timid!
Oh—and that hideous Fort Loudon massacre! Oh,
scorch the tongue that says the word! Oh—the
Indians! And me—so timid!”</p>

<p>“Lord, Aunt—” Arabella laid the embroidery-frame
on her knees and gazed at her relative with
stern, upbraiding eyes, “you know you lamented to
discover that we were not to pass Fort Loudon on
our journey, for you said it would be ‘a sight to remember,
frightful but improving, like a man hung
in chains.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale softly beat her hands together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“To talk of guarding life with his monkey soldiers
against those red painted demons who drink blood
and eat people—oh!—and me, <i>so timid</i>!”</p>

<p>She desisted suddenly as a light tap fell on the
door and the mess-sergeant entered the room. She
set her cap to rights with both her white, delicate,
wrinkled, trembling hands, and stared with wild half-comprehending
eyes as the man presented the compliments
of Lieutenants Bolt and Jerrold, and Ensigns
Lawrence and Innis, who felt themselves vastly
honored by her invitation to a game of Quadrille,
and would have the pleasure of waiting upon her
this evening at the hour Captain Howard had named.</p>

<p>She made an appropriate rejoinder, and she waited
until the door had closed upon the messenger, for
she rarely “capered,” as her maid called her angry
antics, in the presence of outsiders. Then she said
with low-toned virulence to her niece:—</p>

<p>“The scheming meddler! That father of yours!
<i>That</i> father of yours! Talk of treachery! Wilier
than any Indian! Quadrille! Invite them! Smite
them! Quadrille! Why, Mervyn is not complimented
at all. The same grace extended to each and
every!”</p>

<p>“And why should <i>he</i> be complimented, Aunt
Claudia?”</p>

<p>“No reason in the world, Miss, as far as you are
concerned,” retorted her aunt. “Our compliments
won’t move such as George Mervyn!” Then recovering
her temper,—“I thought a little special distinction
as a dear old friend and a lifelong neighbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
might be fitting. Poor dear Brother must equalize
the whole garrison!”</p>

<p>It seemed to Captain Howard as if with the advent
of his feminine guests had entered elements of doubt
and difficulty of which he had lately experienced a
pleasant surcease. The joy which he had felt as a
fond parent in embracing a good and lovely child,
after a long absence, was too keen to continue in the
intensity of its first moments and was softened to a
gentle and tender content, a habitude of the heart,
even more pleasurable. He was fond, too, in a way,
of his queer sister, and grateful for her fostering care
of his motherless children; he had great consideration
for her whims and not the most remote appreciation
of her peculiar abilities. The abatement of the
joy of reunion was manifest in the fact that her
whims now seemed to dominate her whole personality
and tempered the fervor of his gratitude. He was
already ashamed that he had not invited to the
dinner of welcome the four other gentlemen who
seemed altogether fit for that festivity and made the
occasion one of general rejoicing among his brother
officers and fellow-exiles, rather than a nettlesome
point of exclusion. He was realizing, too, the disproportionate
importance such trifles as the opportunity
for transient pleasures possess in the estimation
of the young, although they have all the
years before them, with the continual recurrence of
conventional incidents. Perhaps the long interval,
debarred from all society of their sphere, rendered the
exclusion a positive deprivation. He regretted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
he had submitted to Mrs. Annandale’s arrogation of
the privilege of choosing the company invited to celebrate
the arrival of the commandant’s daughter at
the frontier fort. He seized upon the first moment
when the rousing of his official conscience freed him,
for the time, to repair the omission. The projected
card-party would seem a device for introducing the
officers in detail, as if this were deemed less awkward
than entertaining them in a body, especially as there
were only two ladies to represent the fair sex in
the company.</p>

<p>To his satisfaction this implied theory of the appropriate
seemed readily adopted. Lieutenant Jerrold
was a man of a conventional, assured address,
his conversation always strictly in good form and
strictly limited. He was little disposed to take
offence where the ground of quarrel seemed untenable
or, on the other hand, to thrust himself forward
where his presence was not warmly encouraged.
He welcomed the invitation as enabling him to pay
his respects to the ladies, which, indeed, seemed incumbent
in the situation, but he had been a trifle
nettled by the postponement of the opportunity. He
had dark hair and eyes; he was tall, pale, and slender,
with a narrow face and a flash of white teeth when he
smiled. He was in many respects a contrast to the
two ensigns—Innis, blue-eyed, blond, and square
visaged, his complexion burned a uniform red by
his frontier campaigns, and Lawrence, who had
suffered much freckling as the penalty of the extreme
fairness of his skin, and who always wore his hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
heavily powdered, to disguise in part the red hue,
which was greatly out of favor in his day. Bolt, the
fort-adjutant, was not likely to add much to the mirth
of nations, or even of the garrison—a heavily-built,
sedate, taciturn man, who would eat his supper
with appreciation and discrimination, and play his
cards most judiciously.</p>

<p>Captain Howard left the mess-hall where the
recipients of his courtesy discussed its intendment
over the remainder of breakfast, and took his way,
his square head wagging now and then with an appreciation
of its own obstinacy, across the snowy
parade.</p>

<p>The gigantic purple slopes of the encompassing
mountains showed here and there where the heavy
masses of the drifts had slipped down by their own
weight, and again the dark foliage of pine and
holly and laurel gloomed amongst the snow-laden
boughs of the bare deciduous trees. The contour,
however, of the great dome-like “balds” was distinct,
of an unbroken whiteness against the dark
slate-tinted sky, uniform of tone from pole to pole.</p>

<p>Many feet had trampled the snow hard on the
parade, and there was as yet no sign of thaw. Feathery
tufts hung between the points of the high stockade
surmounting the ramparts and choked the wheels of
the four small cannon that were mounted on each
of the four bastions. The cheeks of the deep embrasures
out of which their black muzzles pointed
were blockaded with drifts, and the scarp and counterscarp
were smooth, and white, and untrodden.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
The roofs of the block-houses were covered, and all
along the northern side of the structures was a thin
coating of snow clinging to the logs, save where the
protuberant upper story overhung and sheltered the
walls beneath. Close about the chimney of the building
wherein was situated the mess-hall, the heat of
the great fire below had melted the drifts, and a
cordon of icicles clung from the stone cap, whence the
dark column of smoke rushed up and, with a vigorous
swirl through the air, made off into invisibility
without casting a shadow in this gray day. He could
see the great conical “state-house” on a high mound
of the Indian settlement of Old Keowee Town, across
the river; it was as smooth and white as a marble
rotunda. The huddled dwellings were on a lower
level and invisible from his position on the parade.
As he glanced toward the main gate he paused suddenly.
Before the guard-house the guard had been
turned out, a glittering line of scarlet across the snow.
The little tower above the gate was built in somewhat
the style of a belfry, and through the open
window the warder, like the clapper of a bell, stood
drooping forward, gazing down at a group of blanketed
and feather-crested figures, evidently Indians,
desiring admission and now in conference with the
officer of the guard. Captain Howard quickened his
steps toward the party, and Raymond, perceiving his
approach, advanced to meet him. There was a hasty,
low-toned colloquy. Then “Damn <i>all</i> the Indians!”
cried Captain Howard, angrily. “Damn them
<i>all</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“The parson says ‘No’!” Raymond submitted,
with a glance of raillery.</p>

<p>“This is no occasion for your malapert wit, sir,”
the captain retorted acridly.</p>

<p>Ordinarily Captain Howard was accessible to a
pleasantry and himself encouraged a jovial insouciance
as far as it might promote the general
cheerfulness, but this incident threatened a renewal
of a long strain of perplexity and dubious diplomacy
and doubtful menace. It was impossible to weigh
events. A trifle of causeless discontent among the
Indians might herald downright murder. A real
and aggravated grievance often dragged itself out
and died of inanition in long correspondence with
the colonial authorities, or the despatch of large and
expensive delegations to Charlestown for those diplomatic
conferences with the governor of South Carolina
which the Indians loved and which flattered the
importance of the head-men.</p>

<p>He strove visibly for his wonted self-balanced
poise, and noticing that the young officer flushed,
albeit silent, as needs must, he felt that he had
taken unchivalrous advantage of the military etiquette
which prevented a retort. He went on with a grim
smile:—</p>

<p>“Where is this missionary now, who won’t give
the devil his due.”</p>

<p>“The emissaries don’t tell, sir. Somewhere on the
Tugaloo River, they give me to understand.”</p>

<p>“And what the fiend does he there?”</p>

<p>“Converts the Indians to Christianity, sir, if he
can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“And they resist conversion?”</p>

<p>“They say he plagues them with many words.”</p>

<p>Captain Howard nodded feelingly.</p>

<p>“They say he unsettles the minds of the people,
who grow slack in the observance of their ‘old beloved’
worship. He reviles their religion, and offends
‘the Ancient White Fire.’”</p>

<p>“There is no rancor like religious rancor, no deviltry
like pious strife,” said Captain Howard, in genuine
dismay. “Nothing could so easily rouse the Indians
anew.”</p>

<p>He paused in frowning anxiety. “Stop me, sir,
this man is monstrous short of a Christian, himself,
to jeopardize the peace and put the whole frontier
into danger for his zeal—just now when the tribe
is fairly pacified. This threatens Fort Prince George
first of all.”</p>

<p>He set his square jaw as he thought of his daughter
and his sister.</p>

<p>Raymond instinctively knew what was passing in
his mind, and forgetful of his sharp criticism volunteered
reassurance.</p>

<p>“The delegation speak, sir, as if only the missionary
were in danger.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t they burn him, then, sir—kindle the
fire with his own prayer-book!” cried Captain
Howard, furiously. Danger from the Indians—now!
with Arabella and Claudia at Fort Prince
George! He could not tolerate the idea. Even in
their defeated and disconsolate estate the Cherokees
could bring two thousand warriors to the field—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the garrison of Fort Prince George numbered scant
one hundred, rank and file.</p>

<p>“It might be the beginning of trouble,” suggested
Raymond, generously disregarding the acerbity with
which his unsought remarks had been received.
“You know how one burning kindles the fires of
others—how one murder begins a massacre.”</p>

<p>“Lord—Lord—yes!” exclaimed Captain Howard.
“What ails the wretch?—are there no sinners
at Fort Prince George that he must go hammering
at the gates of heaven for the vile red fiends?
And what a murrain would they do there! I can
see Moy Toy having a ‘straight talk’ with Saint
Peter, and that one-eyed murderer, Rolloweh, quiring
to a gilded harp! Is there no way of getting at the
man? Will they not let him come back now?”</p>

<p>“They have asked him to leave the country.”</p>

<p>“And what said he?” demanded Captain Howard.</p>

<p>“The delegation declare that he said, ‘Woe!’”</p>

<p>“Whoa!” echoed Captain Howard, in blank
amaze.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,—that was his answer to them in conclave
in their beloved square. ‘Woe!’”</p>

<p>“Whoa!” repeated Captain Howard, stuck fast in
misapprehension. “I think he means, Get-up-and-go-’long!”</p>

<p>Raymond had a half-hysteric impulse to laugh, and
yet it was independent of any real amusement.</p>

<p>“I fancy he meant, ‘Woe is unto him if he preach
not the gospel,’” he said. “The Indians remember
one word only—‘Woe!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“He shall preach the gospel hereafter at Fort
Prince George! Is there no way to quiet the man?”</p>

<p>“You know the Indians’ methods, sir. I think
they have some demand to make of you, but they will
not enter on it for twenty-four hours. They want
accommodations and a conference to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Zounds!” exclaimed Captain Howard, in the
extremity of impatience. In this irregular frontier
warfare he had known many a long-drawn, lingering
agony of suspense—but he felt as if he could not
endure the ordeal with all he now had at stake, his
daughter, his sister, as hostages to the fortunes of
war. He had an impulse to take the crisis as it were
in the grasp of his hand and crush it in the moment.
He could not wait—yet wait he must.</p>

<p>“They only vouchsafed as much as I have told
you in order to secure the conference,” said Raymond.
“I gave them to understand that the time
of our ‘beloved man’ was precious and not to be
expended on trifles. But they held back the nature
of the demand on you and the whereabouts of the
parson.”</p>

<p>“I pray God, they have not harmed the poor old
man!” exclaimed Captain Howard fervently, with a
sudden revulsion of sentiment.</p>

<p>They both glanced toward the gate where the
deputation stood under the archway. The sun was
shining faintly and the wan light streamed through
the portal. The shadows duplicated the number and
the attitudes of the blanketed and feather-crested
figures, all erect, and stark, and motionless, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
in blank silence at the conference of the two officers.
The shadows had a meditative pose, a sort of pondering
attention, and when suddenly the sun darkened
and the shadows vanished, the effect was as if some
dimly visible councillors had whispered to the Indians
and were mysteriously resolved into the medium
of the air.</p>

<p>They received Raymond on his return with their
characteristic expressionless stolidity, and when the
quarter-master appeared, hard on Captain Howard’s
withdrawal, with the order for their lodgement in
a cluster of huts just without the works, reserved
for such occasions and such guests, they repaired
thither without a word, and Raymond, looking after
them from the gate, soon beheld the smoke ascending
from their fires and the purveying out of the good
cheer of the hospitality of Fort Prince George. He
noticed a trail of blood on the snow, where the quarter-master’s
men had laid down for a moment a quarter of
beef, and in this he recognized a special compliment,
for beef was a rarity with the Indians—venison and
wild-fowl being their daily fare.</p>

<p>As the day waxed and waned he often cast his eye
thither noting their movements. They came out in
a body in the afternoon and repaired together to the
trading-house, situated near the bank of the river,
and occupied as a home as well as a store by the
Scotch trader and his corps of assistants. That fire-water
would be in circulation Raymond did not doubt,
for to refuse it would work more disturbance than to
set it forth in moderation. There were many regulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
in hindrance of its sale, but rarely enforced, and
he doubted if the trader would forego his profit even
at the risk of the displeasure of the commandant.
Some difficulty they evidently encountered, however,
in procuring it. They all came back immediately and
disappeared in their huts, and there was no sign of life
in all the bleak landscape, save the vague smoke from
the Indian town across the river and the dark wreaths
from the fires of the delegation. The woods stood
sheeted and white at the extremity of the space beyond
the glacis, cleared to prevent too close an approach
of an enemy and the firing into the fort from
the branches of trees within range. The river was
like rippled steel, its motion undiscerned on its surface,
and its flow was silent. The sky was still gray
and sombre; at one side of the fort the prongs and
boughs of the abattis thrust darkly up through the
snow that lodged among them.</p>

<p>Somewhat after the noon hour he noticed a party
of Indians, vagrant-like, kindling a fire in a sheltered
space in the lee of a rock and feeding on the carcass
of a deer lately killed. The feast was long, but when
it was ended they sat motionless, fully gorged, all in
a row, squatting, huddled in their blankets and eying
the fort, seemingly aimless as the time passed and the
fire dwindled and died, neither sleeping nor making
any sign. When the Indians of the delegation accommodated
in the huts issued again and once more
hopefully took their way to the trading-house, they
must have seen, coming or going, this row of singular
objects, like roosting birds, dark against the snow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
silently contemplating with unknown, unknowable,
savage thoughts the little fort. There was no suggestion
of recognition or communication. Each band
was for the other as if it did not exist. The delegation
wended its way to the trading-house, and presently
returned, and once more sought the emporium,
and again repaired to the temporary quarters. The
snow between the two points began to show a heavily
trampled path.</p>

<p>That these migrations were not altogether without
result became evident when one of the Indians, zig-zagging
unsteadily in the rear, wandered from the
beaten track, stumbled over the stump of a tree concealed
by a drift, floundered unnoticed for a time,
unable to rise, and at last lay there so still and so
long that Raymond began to think he might freeze
should he remain after the chill of the nightfall.
But as the skies darkened two of the Indians came
forth and dragged him into one of their huts, which
were beginning to show as dull red sparks of light
in the gathering dusk. And still beyond the abattis
that semblance of birds of ill-omen was discernible
against the expanse of white snow, as with their
curious, racial, unimagined whim the vagrant savages
sat in the cold and watched the fort. They did not
stir when the sunset gun sounded and the flag fluttered
gently down from the staff. The beat of drums shook
the thick air, and the yearning sweetness of the
bugle’s tone, as it sounded for retreat, found a responsive
vibration even in the snow-muffled rocks.
Again and again it was lovingly reiterated, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
tender resonance thrilled vaguely a long time down
the dim cold reaches of the river.</p>

<p>Lights had sprung up in the windows. A great
yellow flare gushed out from the open door of the
mess-hall, and the leaping flames of the gigantic fireplace
could be seen across the parade. The barracks
were loud with jovial voices. Servants bearing trays
of dishes were passing back and forth from the
kitchen to the commandant’s quarters. The vigorous
tramp of the march of soldiers made itself heard
even in the snow as the corporal of the guard went
out with the relief. A star showed in the dull gray
sky that betokened in the higher atmosphere motion
and shifting of clouds. A faint, irresolute, roseate
tint lay above the purple slope to the west with a
hesitant promise of a fair morrow. The light faded,
the night slipped down, and the sentries began to
challenge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the fashion of the time and place to be
zealous in flattering the Indian’s sense of importance,
and the hospitality of the fort was constantly asserted
in plying the delegation with small presents.
Shortly after nightfall the quarter-master-sergeant
went out to the Indian huts with some tobacco and
pipes, and tafia, and the compliments of the commandant.
He returned with the somewhat significant
information that they needed no tafia. A few,
he stated, were sober, but saturnine and grave.
Others were blind drunk. The most troublesome
had reached the jovial stage. From where they lay
recumbent they had caught the soldier by one leg
and then by the other, tumbled him on the floor,
and tripped him again and again as he sought to
rise; finally, he made his way by scrambling on all
fours out into the snow, and running for the gate
with two or three of the staggering braves at his
heels.</p>

<p>“Faix, if the commandant has any more complimints
to waste on thim Injun gossoons,” he remarked,
as he stood, panting and puffing, under the
archway while the guard clustered at gaze in the
big door of the guard-house, “by the howly poker,
he may pursint them in person! For the divil be in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
ivery fut I’ve got if I go a-nigh them cu’rus bogies
agin! They ain’t human. Wait, me b’ye, till I git
me breath, an’ I’ll give ye the countersign, if I haven’t
forgot ut. I’m constructively on the outside yit,
seein’ ye cannot let me in till I gives ye the countersign.”</p>

<p>There was a low-toned murmur.</p>

<p>“Pass, friend,” said the sentinel.</p>

<p>“Thankin’ ye fur nothin’,” the quarter-master-sergeant
rejoined as he paused under the archway
to gaze back over the snow.</p>

<p>“If Robin Dorn ain’t a frog or a tadpole to grow
a new laig if one is pulled off,” he remarked, “he’ll
hardly make the fort to-night.”</p>

<p>The sentinel, left alone at the gate, peered out
into the bleak dark waste. All suggestion of light
had faded from the sky, and that the ground was
white showed only where the yellow gleams from the
doors and windows of the fort fell upon the limited
space of the snowy parade. Soon these dwindled to a
lantern in front of the silent barracks and a vague
glimmer from the officers’ mess-hall, where the great
fire was left all solitary to burn itself out. A light
still shone through the windows of the commandant’s
quarters, where he was entertaining company at
cards. But otherwise the fort was lapsing to
quiescence and slumber.</p>

<p>A wind began to stir in the woods. More than
once the sentinel heard the dull thud of falling
masses of snow and the clashing together of bare
boughs. Then the direction of the current of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
air changed; it wavered and gradually its force failed,
a deep stillness ensued and absolute darkness prevailed.
The sound of crunching, as wolves or dogs
gnawed, snarling, the bones of the deer that the
vagrant savages had killed beyond the abattis, was
distinct to his ear. It was a cold night and a dreary.
The vigilance of watching with naught in expectation
is a strain upon the attention which a definite menace
does not exert. There was now no thought of danger
from the Indians, who were fast declining from the
character of warriors and marauders to that of mendicants
and aimless intruders and harmless pests. The
soldier knew his duty and was prepared to do it, but
to maintain a close guard in these circumstances was
a vexatious necessity. He paced briskly up and
down to keep his blood astir.</p>

<p>A break in the dull monotony can never be so
welcome as to a dreary night-watch. He experienced
a sense of absolute pleasure in the regulation appearance
of the officer of the day, crossing the parade
and challenged by the sentinel before the guard-house
door. The brisk turning out of the guard was like
a reassurance of the continued value and cheer of
life. The flare from the guard-house door showed
the lines of red uniforms, the glitter of the bayonets,
the muskets carried at “shoulder arms!” the officer
of the guard, Raymond, at his post, and the sergeant
advancing to the stationary figure, waiting in
the snow. He watched the familiar scene, on which
in the day-time he would not have bestowed a
glance, as if it had some new and eager significance—so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
do trifles of scant interest fill the void of
mental inactivity.</p>

<p>The crisp young voices were musical to his ear as
they rang out in the night with the stereotyped
phrases. “Advance, officer of the day, and give
the countersign!” cried the sergeant. Then as
Mervyn advanced and a whispered colloquy ensued,
the dapper sergeant whirled briskly, smartly saluting
the officer of the guard with the cry—as of discovery—“The
countersign is right!”</p>

<p>“Advance officer of the day,” said Raymond.</p>

<p>The two officers approached each other and the
sentinel, losing interest in their unheard, whispered
conference as Mervyn gave the parole, turned his
eyes to the wild waste without. He was startled to
see vaguely, dubiously, in some vagrant, far glimmer
of the flare from the guard-house door or the swinging
flicker of the lantern carried by one of the two men
who, with a non-commissioned officer, was preparing
to accompany the officer of the day on his rounds,
a strange illusion, as close as the parapet of the covered
way. There were dark figures against the snow,
crouching dog-like or wolf-like—and yet he knew
them to be Indians. They were gazing at the illuminated
military manœuvre set in the flare of yellow
light in the midst of the dark night. The sentinel
could not be sure of their number, their distance. He
cried out harshly—“Who goes there! The guard!
The guard!”</p>

<p>In one moment the guard, put to double-quick, was
under the archway of the gate. A detail was sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
out in swift reconnaissance with the corporal’s lantern
and returned without result. There was naught to
be found. The barren wintry expanse of the glacis
was vacant. Nothing stirred save a wind blowing in
infrequent, freakish gusts that struck the snow with
sudden flaws and sent a shower of stinging icy particles
upward into the chill red faces as the men rushed
hither and thither. The huts of the Indians were
silent, dark, the inmates apparently locked in slumber.
Bethinking himself of the untoward possibilities of a
sudden tumult among the Indians in the confusion
and darkness,—whether they might interpret the
demonstration from the fort as aggression or consternation,—Raymond
on this account ordered the
party to return silently to Fort Prince George through
the sally-port. The same idea had occurred to
Mervyn, for when the ensign rejoined him at the
main gate he was administering a sharp rebuke to
the sentry for raising a false alarm. It seemed,
however, to Raymond that it left much to the discretion
of an ordinary soldier to permit him to
discriminate between inaction and the reference to
his officer’s judgment of such a demonstration as he
had described.</p>

<p>“You saw nothing,” Mervyn said, severely. “You
are either demented, or drunk, or dreaming.”</p>

<p>He turned away, then suddenly stepped back to
admonish the sentry to raise no such disturbance
when Robin Dorn should return from the trader’s.</p>

<p>“Don’t mistake the drummer-boy for an army
with banners!” he said, scornfully. And having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
concluded his visit to the guard he once more flung
off and disappeared in the darkness of the parade.
Raymond lingered after ordering the guard within.
Perhaps it was a bit of meddlesome jealousy, perhaps
a resentment of Mervyn’s manner, which seemed unwontedly
high-handed to-night, although there had
been naught but the official business between them,
perhaps he thought it dangerous to curb so severely
the zeal of a sentry under these peculiar circumstances,
but he plied the soldier with questions and considerately
weighed his contradictory statements and
seemed sympathetically aware that these inconsistencies
were not intentional perversions of fact,
but the impossibility of being sure of aught when
all was invested with mystery. Raymond’s mind
bent to the conviction that there was no admixture
of fancy in the sentry’s story. Whatever was the
intent of the demonstration on the part of the Indians,—whether
to rush the gate and overpower the guard,
or merely the malicious joy in creating an alarm and
a fierce relish of being an object of terror, or even,
simpler still, a childish curiosity in the military
routine of going the rounds—it was certainly a
genuine fact and no vision, drowsy or drunken.</p>

<p>It had latterly been the habit to leave the gates
open for the sheer sake of convenience, after the
foolhardy fashion of the frontier. Strange as it
may seem in view of the universal distrust of the
good faith of the Indians, the universal conviction
of their inherent racial treachery, the repeated
demonstration of their repudiation of the sanctities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
of all pledges, many a massacre found its opportunity
in the heedless disregard of the commonest precautions.
Raymond now ordered the gates to be
closed and barred, and instructed the sentinel to send
Robin Dorn for admittance to the sally-port beneath
the rampart. He repaired to the guard-house, and,
still doubtful, he ordered the corporal with two men
to attend him, stating to the sergeant, as next in
rank, his intention to reconnoitre from the northern
ramparts and the slope of the abattis, to discover
if the curious birds of ill-omen still crouched at gaze
or whither they had betaken themselves and with
what intent. It was understood that he would
return in a quarter of an hour, and quiet settled
down on the precincts of the guard-room.</p>

<p>Robin Dorn was of that unclassified species, too
tall, too long of limb, too stalwart of build for a
boy, and yet too young, too raw, too inconsequent
and unreasoning for a man. The simple phrase,
“hobble-de-hoy,” might adequately describe his
estate in life. His errand had been to secure from
the trading-house the drum-sticks of a new drum to
replace one with a burst cylinder, which the commandant
had ordered in Charlestown, through the
trader. The instrument had been duly delivered, but
the drum-sticks had been overlooked. Upon this discovery
the drummer had requested leave to repair to
the trader’s in the hope that the sticks were among
the smaller commodities of the cargo, just arrived by
pack-train, the convoy, indeed, under whose protection
the ladies of the captain’s household and he himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
had travelled. The confusion incident upon opening
a variety of goods which had been packed with
the sole effort to compress as much as possible in the
smallest compass was not a concomitant of speed.
Robin’s efforts to tousle and tumble through the
whole stock in his search were sternly repressed by
the trader’s assistants, and even the merchant now
and then admonished him with—“Wow, pig, take
your foot out the trough!” He was fain at last to
sit on a keg of gun-powder, and watch the unrolling
of every bit of merchandise, solemnly disposed in
its place on the shelf before the next article was
handled. Now and again a cheerful,—“Heigh, sirs!
Here they are!” called out in the unrolling of a piece
of stroud cloth, wherein was folded wooden spoons,
or a dozen table-knives, or a long pistol, heralded a
disappointment which Robin manifested so dolorously
that the trader was fain to mutter—“Bide
a wee, Robbie, bide a wee—” and offer a sup of liquid
consolation. So long the search continued that the
new goods were all sorted and fairly ranged upon the
shelves before the drum-sticks revealed themselves,
stuffed separately in a pair of leggings which they inadequately
filled out, and the night had long ago
descended upon the snowy environs of the little
fort.</p>

<p>“If the sentry winna pass me ye’ll hae to gie me
a bit sup o’ parritch an’ my bed the nicht,” he stipulated,
modestly, in reply to the profuse apologies and
commiseration of his host. “I kenna the countersign,
an’ ye wad na hae me shake down wi’ them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Injuns in the huts yon. I mis-doubt they hae fleas,
though ’tis winter.”</p>

<p>“Dinna ye gae nigh ’em, bairn,” the kindly trader
seriously admonished him. “Fleas is not the way
thae dour savages will let your blood. Gif the sentry
winna let ye come ben e’en turn back, callant;—but
if ye are thinkin’ they winna sort ye for it, ye
are welcome to stay the nicht here, without seeking
to win the fort.”</p>

<p>“Na—na—I’m fair fain to hear how these birkies
will march to the tune of ‘Dumbarton’s Drums’!”</p>

<p>Robin caught up the sticks between his practised
fingers, and in dumb show beat a spirited measure on
the empty air. His red uniform, his cocked hat,
showing his flaxen curls, his frank sun-burned face,
and his laughing blue eyes, all combined to make up
an appealing picture to the elder men, and despite
a qualm of reluctance the trader could not refrain
from saying, “Take a horn, callant, before you gae
out in the air—you’ve a sair hoast now.”</p>

<p>With this reinforcement to his earlier potations,—still
he was not what a Scotchman would call drunk,—Robin
set out with swift strides in the black
night, a drum-stick in either hand, in the direction
of the fort. He might only know where it lay by a
vague suffusion in a certain quarter of unappeasable
bleak darkness—a sort of halo, as it were, the joint
effect, he was aware, of the occasional opening of the
guard-room door, the feeble glimmer of the lanterns
hanging in the barrack galleries and outside the
officers’ quarters, and the light that dully burned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
all night in the hospital, gleaming from the
windows.</p>

<p>After a time a dim red spot toward the left showed
him where lay the Indian camp. Now it became
invisible as some undulation of the ground interposed,
or some drift heavily submerged one of the
myriad stumps of the cleared-away forest. Sometimes
he ran into these in the blinding night, and
once he stumbled, floundering so deep that he thought
he had fallen into some pit sunk there in the days of
the war to entrap an enemy—the remnants of an
exploded mine, perhaps, or <i>trous-de-loup</i>. But he
came upon hard ground with no mishap, save the loss
of one of his drum-sticks, found after much groping.
As he regained the perpendicular he noted that the
red glow, indicating the Indian camp, seemed, now
that he was nearer, but the light from embers. It
was odd that their fires should die down. Ordinarily
the flames were kept flaring high throughout the
night, to scare away wolves and panthers. When
this thought struck him he drew a long knife from
his belt and passed his fingers gingerly along its
keen edge, then thrust it anew into its sheath. But
if the Indians were not there, whither had they
vanished? The unfriendly, veiled night, with a suggestion
as of an implacable enmity in its unresponsive
silence, its bitter chill, its sinister, impenetrable obscurity,
was appalling in the possibility that its vast
invisibilities harbored these strange, savage beings,
wandering, who knew where and with what ferocious
intent. Robin Dorn suddenly began to run impetuously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
stumbling where he could not heed, falling
if he needs must, with his right arm advanced, as if
the night were a palpable thing and he shouldered
through obstacles in the obscurity. He met naught.
He crossed the glacis, ran along the covered way,
reached the brink of the counterscarp, and wavered
at the little bridge above the ditch as the warder
from the lookout tower challenged him with a stern—“Halt!
Who goes there?”</p>

<p>“Robin Dorn. An’ I hinna the countersign.
There’s a wheen Injuns flittering around yon. Let
me come ben. What for have ye got the great yett
steekit?”</p>

<p>“Come around to the little gate, Sawney!” said
the sentinel below, after a word to his comrade aloft.
“The sally-port is big enough for the likes of you.”</p>

<p>“I’m fair froze,” Robin whimpered, as the smaller
postern at last opened to admit him. “Ohone!
You’ve kep’ me jiggling an’ dauncing till my ears
are fair frosted!”—he touched them smartly with
his drum-sticks—“an’ me out on the business of
the post! I did na think ye’d have served me sic a
ill turn, Benjie! Steek the yett agin me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, stow your tongue!” retorted the sentinel.
“I had nothing to <i>do</i> with closing the gate—the
guard closed it. Get along with you.”</p>

<p>Robin shuffled along through the snow, bent half
double and feeling pierced with the chill which he
had sustained while waiting at the gate, over-heated
as he was from running. He paused as he passed in
front of the guard-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“What for did the guard steek the yett agin me?”
he demanded of the sentinel on the step. “I’ll complain
to the officer of the guard!”</p>

<p>“Go to bed, you zany!” returned the sentinel,
“the officer of the guard is not here.”</p>

<p>“Heigh, sirs,” cried the harum-scarum boy. “Say
ye sae! I’ll e’en tak a keek at the guard-room
fire!” He sprang past the sentinel and was in the
room in a moment.</p>

<p>The great fire flared tumultuously in the deep
chimney-place; the white-washed room, despite its
ample proportions, was warm, and snug, and clean.
The light glittered on the arms stacked in the centre
of the floor in readiness at a moment’s warning. On
the broad hearth of stone flagging, the soldiers, all
fully accoutred and arrayed, despite the hour, in
their scarlet uniforms, were ranged; several sat on
each of the high-backed settles on either side of
the chimney. All looked up as the door opened and
the drummer shot in, the sentinel protesting behind
him. The door of the prison beyond was half ajar,
the sergeant having stepped in to examine an inmate,
confined for some military misdemeanor, who was
complaining of sudden illness.</p>

<p>“Why, Robin,” one of the guard called out, jocosely.
“Avaunt! Depart! This is no place for you!”</p>

<p>He was a big, clumsy, red-faced young Briton, and
he rose and came with a lurching gait toward the
drummer, who stood, smiling, a mischievous glint
in his blue eyes, his cocked hat set back on his flaxen
curls, his face flushed with the nipping chill without,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
and his red coat and leggings covered with a frosting
of snow, evidently relishing the freak of his intrusion
here in the absence of the officers, and full of animal
spirits and fun.</p>

<p>“Wha’s gaun to mak me gae, the noo?” he demanded,
capering on his long legs.</p>

<p>“Faix, thin, I will, me b’ye!” cried an Irishman,
springing up from the hearth, eager for even the
semblance of a shindy. As he ran at the drummer,
head down, Robin lifted the drum-sticks and beat a
brisk rub-a-dub on his crown; then as his English
comrade came to the rescue, the boy whisked about
and, being the taller by a head, despite his youth, he
made the drum-sticks rattle about the older man’s
ears and his skull ring like the drawn membrane of
the new snare drum. The others sprang up in a body
and rushed gayly at the light and agile drummer, still
plying his sticks on every cranium that came within
his reach, whisking among them, darting from one to
another, slipping under their out-stretched arms and
setting many a head to ringing with a tune all its
own, till finally he was surrounded, collared, caught
up bodily and fairly flung outside in the deepest
drift near at hand. There he wallowed futilely
struggling, for a moment overcome with laughter and
frantic exertion; finally, he found his feet and made
off, tingling with warmth and jollity, toward the
barracks. He was fairly housed there when the guard-house
door opened to admit the officer of the guard,
the corporal, and the two men with the lantern, and
the opposite door closed by the re-entrance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
sergeant from the sick patient. Both officers stood
at gaze; the men were shambling and shuffling, a
trifle shame-facedly, about the room, deeply flushed,
some still mechanically laughing, and breathing hard
and fast, though all assumed the stiff regulation
attitude of the soldier.</p>

<p>“What is all this, Sergeant?” demanded Raymond.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir,” answered the second in command.
“I’ve been looking after Peters—he seems
better now.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter, men?” Raymond turned to
the soldiers.</p>

<p>“Just a bit of fun, sir,” one of them responded,
puffingly, his breath still short.</p>

<p>“This is no time or place for wrestling and horse-play,”
Raymond admonished them.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir,” another replied, “that little fool
drummer stopped here as he came in the fort, and we
put him out.”</p>

<p>“Half frozen, I dare say. I see no fun in that,”
responded Raymond. Then because the night was
long and monotonous, and the reconnaissance unfruitful,
and the fire genial, as he stood before it, and subversive
of unbending—“What was the joke?” he
demanded, feeling that a flavor of joviality might
season the arid and tasteless interval of time.</p>

<p>The men hesitated, looking doubtfully from one
to the other. But Raymond was a favorite among
them, and his query could not be disregarded. In
view of their sentiment toward him they did not
seek a subterfuge or to baffle his curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“’Twon’t be like reporting on the gossoon, Ensign?”
demanded the Irishman, anxiously, and with the negative
reply he burst into a spirited detail of the drum-beating
episode and the freakish drum-sticks.</p>

<p>“We were not goin’ to put up with the loikes av
that, Ensign, av course,” he concluded. “As soon
as we cud lay hands on the slippery little baste, we
doubled up the long legs av him an’ flung him out into
a snow-drift.”</p>

<p>Raymond smiled indulgently as he stood before
the fire, looking down thoughtfully into the bed of
coals, glistening to a white heat under the flaming
logs. Then he turned away.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll see Peters, Sergeant. If he is as bad
as he was, he must be sent to the hospital.” Thus
he disappeared into the inner room.</p>

<p>The group of soldiers resumed their places on
the settle and on the hearth before the flaming fire.
By slow degrees the long night wore away. Now
and again the fire was replenished, but as the hours
passed it was suffered to burn low, for the weather
had moderated. The clouds thinned and fell apart,
and when the relief went out there were stars in a
chill glitter in a clear dark sky. The wind was astir;
it was blowing from the south. Again and again a
commotion within the forest verges told of dislodged
drifts from the branches of the trees. The thaw set
in before dawn, and when the sun appeared in a gorgeous
emblazonment of deep red, and purplish pink,
and roseate saffron on the opaline sky, its light suffused
a world all adrip with moisture, and the slopes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
of the neighboring mountains, darkly purple, were
half veiled in shimmering mists, that reached from
creek and valley to the zenith and hung in the air in
motionless suspension. The Keowee River was of
a dull, rippled slate-color, till a sudden shaft of light
struck out a steely gleam as if a blade had been suddenly
unsheathed. The bugle’s stirring acclaim of
the reveille rang out to far distant coverts of the
mountain, where the deer, coming down to drink,
paused to listen, and the marauding wolf, and catamount,
and panther, cogeners of the night, slunk to
their caverns and dens, as if warned by the voice of
the morn to vex no more for a season the peace of
harmless wildlings. The sun-rise gun smote the air
with all its dull echoes booming after. The flag rose
buoyantly to the tip of the staff. The Indian town
of Old Keowee, on the opposite bank of the river, was
all astir, and now and again the sonorous note of the
conch-shell, a detail of the matutinal savage worship,
blended oddly with the martial resonance of the
British drums beating for roll-call as the garrison of
Fort Prince George lined up in front of the barracks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> influence of the masterful Mrs. Annandale at
Fort Prince George was felt on the parade that morning
ere guard-mounting was fairly concluded. The
old guard had been paraded, presenting arms, as the
new guard, with arms shouldered, marched past,
the band playing, the officers punctiliously saluting,
the whole conducted with as much ceremony as if the
garrison numbered ten thousand men. These strict
observances were held to foster the self-respect of the
soldier as well as conserve discipline. Even off duty
the rigors of military etiquette, as between the rank and
file and the officers, were never permitted to be relaxed.
Among the officers, themselves, however, formality,
save as strictly official, was altogether ignored. So
few they were, in exclusive constant association by
reason of the loneliness, that they were like a band
of brothers, and the equality always pervading a
mess, in which the distinctions of rank are by common
consent annulled in the interests of good fellowship,
was peculiarly pronounced. Therefore Raymond,
walking across the parade to the mess-hall, now off
duty,—his sentinels had been relieved and his report
duly sent by a non-commissioned officer to the officer
of the day,—was somewhat surprised by a very commanding
gesture from Mervyn signing him to pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Captain-Lieutenant Mervyn certainly had no aspect
resembling a sheep as he crossed the parade. He
was erect, alert; he stepped swiftly; his eyes were
bright and intent, his cheek was flushed, and he had
an imperious manner. So uncharacteristic was his
look that Raymond was conscious of staring in surprise
as they met. Mervyn cast so significant a glance
at the subaltern’s hand that it was borne in upon the
junior that he considered the occasion official, and expected
the formal salute. Raymond, half offended, had
yet a mind to laugh, Mervyn’s manner being so pervaded
by a sense of his superiority in rank as well
as all else. The ensign saluted with a half-mocking
grace, and the captain-lieutenant gravely responded.</p>

<p>“Ensign Raymond,” said Mervyn, “you were officer
of the guard yesterday and relieved to-day.”</p>

<p>“Even so,” assented Raymond.</p>

<p>Mervyn lifted his eye-brows, and Raymond knew that
he desired the formal “Yes, sir.” He was suddenly
angered by this unusual proceeding. He saw that
something was much amiss with his senior, but he could
not imagine that still rankling in Mervyn’s consciousness
was the recollection of the laughing delight and
ridicule in his eyes the evening of the dinner upon
the dénouement of the gypsy story. He knew of
naught that should render their relations other than
they had hitherto been. He protested to himself that
he would not be a fool, and stand here saluting, and
frowning, and majoring with importance, as if they
had some military matter of moment pending between
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“What the devil, Mervyn, do you want?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Mervyn gave him a stony stare. Then, still formally,
he went on. “As officer of the day I received
your report as officer of the guard. No mention was
made—” he unfolded a paper in his hand and referred
to it—“of a very unusual proceeding which
took place during your tour of service.”</p>

<p>“Was not the arrival of the delegation mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Mervyn said, his eyes still on the paper.
Raymond reached forth his hand, as if to take it,
but his superior held it fast; Raymond felt as if he
were suspected of a design upon it, to suppress it.
Therefore he desisted, merely asking, “Was there not
a statement of their intoxication?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Their sudden appearance at the gates,—watching
the guard turn out for the officer of the day, and
the closing of the gates?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p>“Then, what else?” Raymond demanded, bewildered.</p>

<p>“You omitted a circumstance known to no officer
but yourself,” said Mervyn, severely.</p>

<p>“I mentioned Peters and his illness—isn’t it
there?” he could hardly forbear snatching the paper
to see for himself.</p>

<p>“You did not mention the intrusion of the drummer,”
said Mervyn, sternly. “I overheard the men
laughing about it to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the little drummer’s frolic—that was a
trifle,” said Raymond, trying to smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“You suppressed this matter in your report. It
was your duty to report any unusual circumstances.
You will see on this paper under the head of ‘Remarks’
no mention of this circumstance.”</p>

<p>“Lord, man, it was altogether immaterial!” cried
Raymond, excessively nettled by this reflection on
his conduct as an officer.</p>

<p>“Disorderly behavior, interference with guard-duty,
intoxication, and buffoonery out of place are
serious breaches of conduct, of evil example, and subversive
of discipline. These seem to me very material
subjects for report.”</p>

<p>“Stop me—Mervyn—but you are playing the
fool!” cried Raymond, quite beside himself with
rage.</p>

<p>“I find it my duty as officer of the day in adding
my report to the guard report to mention this failure
of duty on your part. And unless you change your
tone, sir, I shall also report you for insolence and
insubordination to your superior officer.”</p>

<p>His steady, steely look forced a mechanical salute
from Raymond as Mervyn turned away with the
same energy of step, burning cheek, and flashing eye.
He resolved within himself that he would be nobody’s
fool, and he certainly looked “nobody’s
sheep.”</p>

<p>Raymond, hurt, amazed, and angry, dashed off
across the parade over the trampled snow, which
was melting in the sun and honey-combed with
myriads of dark cells that cancelled all its remaining
whiteness. Where tufts still clung between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
points of the stockade that surmounted the heavy
red clay ramparts, it still had its pristine glister and
purity. Now and again great masses slipped down
from some roof where it had clung on the northern
exposure, and it was obvious that all would vanish
before the noonday. He hardly paused until he
reached the mess-hall, and when he entered it was
with so hasty a step, so absorbed a mien, that the
officers dully loitering there looked up surprised,
expectant of some disclosure or sensation.</p>

<p>The apartment was spacious and commodious, but
ill-lighted, save for the largess of the great fireplace,
where huge logs blazed or smouldered red and deeply
glowing in a bed of ashes. It was of utility as a
block-house, and the loop-holes for musketry served
better for ventilation than illumination. The walls
illustrated the prowess of the mess as sportsmen.
They were hung with trophies of the chase,—great
branching horns of elk and deer, a succession of scarlet
flamingo feathers and white swan’s wings, all
a-spread in a gorgeous fiction of flight, and the wide,
suggestive pinions of the golden eagle. Among these
were many curios,—quivers, tomahawks, aboriginal
pictures painted on the interior of buffalo hides,
quaint baskets, decorated jugs, and calabashes a
kaleidoscopic medley. The red coats of the officers
gave a note of intense color in the flare of the flames.
On a side table were silver candle-sticks and snuffers—where
the tapers of the previous night had not been
renewed, and had burned to the socket—a token of
luxury in these rude surroundings, intimating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
soldier alien to the wilds, not the pioneer. A punch-bowl
and goblets of silver gilt, suggestive of post-prandial
zest, were on a shelf of sideboard-like usage.
A service of silver and china, with the remnants of
the breakfast, evidently a substantial meal,—trout,
and venison, and honey in the comb, and scones of
Indian meal,—was yet on the table in the lower end
of the room, and a belated partaker still plied knife
and fork.</p>

<p>Raymond might have joined him, for he had not
broken his fast, but he had forgotten physical needs
in the tumult of his feelings. He had great pride in
his efficiency as an officer. He had, too, great hopes
of his military career. All that was best and
noblest in him vibrated to the idea of honor, responsibility,
fitness for high trusts. He could not brook
a disparagement in these essentials. He felt maligned,
his honor impugned, his fair intentions traduced, that
he should be held to have failed in a point of duty—that
he should be made the subject of a report for
negligence or wilful concealment of a breach of discipline.</p>

<p>He had intended to say nothing of the contention.
It seemed a subject which he could not canvass with
the mess. He felt that he could not lend his tongue
to frame the words that he was accused of a failure
of duty. But the languid conversation which had
been in progress was not resumed. Raymond’s
tumultuous entrance had proved an obliteration
rather than an interruption of the subject.</p>

<p>“Anything the matter, Raymond?” asked Lieutenant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Jerrold, who had had a glimpse of the two
officers in conversation on the parade.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Raymond. He had flung himself
down in one of the huge, cumbrous, comfortable
chairs of the post-carpenter’s construction, covered
by buffalo skins. “That is—well—”</p>

<p>The eyes of all were upon him, inquisitive but
kindly. The yearning for sympathy, for reassurance,
for justification, broke down his reserve.</p>

<p>“Mervyn, as officer of the day, is going to report
me for suppressing a breach of discipline, as officer
of the guard.”</p>

<p>Only one of the men, the quarter-master, an old
campaigner, was smoking; this habit he had acquired
from the Indians, for pipes were temporarily
out of fashion, save the cutty of the lower
classes. He was of a ruder type than the others,—a
burly, red-faced, jovial blade, inclined to be
gray, and much disposed to lament what he called
the shrinking of his waistcoat, as he grew portly on
fine fare. He took the long pipe-stem from his
lips, lowered the curiously carved bowl, and looked
inquisitively at the young man’s face.</p>

<p>“Gad-zooks!” incredulously exclaimed the blond
young ensign of the name of Innis.</p>

<p>The fort-adjutant was an older man, and had
seen much service. He was grave, concerned. He
sought a polite palliative.</p>

<p>“The first time since you have been in the service,
I take it.”</p>

<p>Raymond noticed that none of them was swift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
to speech. Mervyn’s disapproval of him carried
weight with them all. The thought sent him wild,—Mervyn,
always so dispassionate, so calm, so self-contained,
with good, slow judgment and an impeccant
record! In his own defence, for his own repute,
they must know the truth. He leaned forward,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Now I put the case to you,—not that I expect
you to express any opinion as between us—” he
added, hastily, marking a general expression of
embarrassed negation. “I was officer of the guard,
and about eleven of the clock, the night being very
dark and a party of Indians having been lying down
among the stakes of the abattis after eating a deer
they had killed, I took the corporal and two men
and visited the sentry posted on that side of the fort.
Then I went out to where we had seen the bucks,
but they had gone. This required some little time.
When I got back to the guard-house I found the men
in great glee. They were laughing and chuckling.
They had a secret that mightily amused them. And,
the night being long and the time dull, to pass it a
bit I asked them—like a fool—what the fun was.
They didn’t wish to tell, yet as I have always been
fair to them, and considered their comfort and favored
them as far as I could, they didn’t wish to refuse.
So out it came. That little Scotch scamp, Robin
Dorn, had leave to go down to the Scotch trader’s,
and it seems the two Sawneys didn’t drink water.
He came back while I was gone, very handsomely
fuddled, I suppose, with two new drum-sticks for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
which he had been sent. The sentry at the gate
passed him, and the guard-house door was open.
In he flew like a whirlwind, with his new drum-sticks,
and beat a rally on as many heads as he could before
they could catch him and pitch him out into the snow.
When I came in a moment later their heads were
all roaring. It was a rough soldier’s joke of a fine
relish to them. They were laughing, and grinning,
and plotting to get even with Robin Dorn.”</p>

<p>There was a languid smile around the circle.</p>

<p>“Now, if this had happened in my presence, or
if I had gained cognizance of it in any way except
as a jest told at my request, for my amusement, or
if it had been material to any interest of the garrison,
I should have mentioned it in my report.”</p>

<p>“Is this what Mervyn calls your failure of duty?”
demanded Bolt, the fort-adjutant.</p>

<p>Raymond nodded a silent assent. The others
exchanged glances of surprised comment, and made
no rejoinder.</p>

<p>“In his report as officer of the day,” said Raymond
at length, “he includes this detail among his remarks
on my report as officer of the guard.”</p>

<p>“Zounds! The commandant can’t take a serious
view of a bit of horse-play behind an officer’s back,”
said Lieutenant Jerrold. He fell to meditating on
Mervyn’s priggish arrogations of gentlemanly perfection,
and he rather wondered that he should place
himself in the position of a persecutive martinet.
The incident was not without its peculiar relish to
Lieutenant Jerrold. Not that he wished aught of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
ill to Ensign Raymond, but he secretly resented, naturally
enough, that he had not been selected instead,
as a guest for the dinner of welcome to the captain’s
daughter. Mervyn’s invitation was, of course, a
foregone conclusion—in the double capacity of old
friend and close neighbor. But it seemed to Jerrold
that since a make-weight was needed, he, himself,
was heavier metal than Raymond. He felt, in a
measure, passed over, excluded, and the subsequent
invitation with the other officers to play a game of
Quadrille hardly made amends, for he claimed some
superior distinction in point of age, in service, in
rank, in personality. He might have been flattered
and his wounded self-love assuaged if he had known
that it was for these identical reasons he had been
passed over. Mrs. Annandale had schemed to avoid
any interference with Mervyn’s opportunity to impress
the young lady and to be impressed in turn. She
had waived away Jerrold’s name when she had
declared that it would be too personal and particular
to invite Mervyn alone, although as old friend and
neighbor she cared only for him,—but since he was
a man of wealth and gilded expectations, she would
not like the officers of the garrison to think she was
throwing precious Arabella at his head. “Doited
dear Brother” took instant alarm at this, and proposed
the next in rank—Lieutenant Jerrold. But
she objected to so considerable a man. She had by
no means the intention of furnishing Captain-Lieutenant
Mervyn with a rival, after she had come all
the way from England to ensnare him for her niece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Save us!” she had exclaimed. “We don’t want
two lieutenants! Send for some simple little ensign,
man; just to balance the table.”</p>

<p>Her heart had sunk into her shoes when she beheld
the face and figure of the make-weight that Captain
Howard, all unconscious of her deep and subtle
schemes, had provided. This Raymond—to balance
the table! But for her own careful exploitation of the
evening the dashing ensign would have unwittingly
destroyed every prospect that had lured her on so long
and grievous a journey. She had enough rancor
against the unconscious and dangerous marplot to
enable her to receive with great relish the tidings
that he was in disfavor with the commandant, for
the cause, always most reprehensible in a soldier,
wilful neglect of duty.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me! There is no excuse for that
sort of thing,” she said, virulently, for Captain Howard
was showing great concern for the incident, and
was of the opinion, evidently, that Mervyn might
well have let the matter rest. “I am not a soldier,
dear Brother, and know nothing of tactical details.
But reason argues that guard-duty is one of the dearest
trusts of a soldier, and will bear no trifling.”</p>

<p>“True, true, indeed,” assented Captain Howard.</p>

<p>“While that rapscallion was playing Killie-crankie
on the heads of those numskulls, the sentry at the
gate might have shouted for the guard in vain. The
gate might have been rushed by an enemy—”</p>

<p>“There was a sentry at the guard-room door who
would have heard; it is his business to notify the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
guard,” Captain Howard interpolated, but without
effect. Mrs. Annandale went on as if he had not
spoken.</p>

<p>“—and though the officer in charge was within
his duty in visiting distant and exposed sentinels,
he should have reported the disturbance occurring
during his absence. No!—no—! Don’t talk to
me!”</p>

<p>“He has the promise of becoming a fine officer,
and it irks me to check and bait him. He means
for the best.”</p>

<p>“Dear Brother, we might be massacred every one, if
the service proceeded on such indulgence to negligence.
The rules and regulations must be observed. The
Articles of War ought to be as sacred as the Thirty-nine
Articles of Religion.”</p>

<p>“True—true—very true—” assented “dear
Brother,” for who could gainsay her.</p>

<p>She was in earnest hope that for a time no more
would be said of the handsome marplot. So serious,
indeed, did she deem his interference that now that
it was removed her spirits mounted high, her wit
sparkled, her flabby, pallid cheek flushed, and her
microscopic eyes glimmered and twinkled among her
wrinkles. So distinct was her sense of carrying all
things before her that she did not notice at first the
change in Mervyn’s manner when he called in formal
fashion to pay his respects to his recent host and
the ladies of the household. The transformation was
complete—no longer mild, pale, docile of aspect. He
held himself tensely erect; his face was flushed; his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
eyes glittered with a light not altogether friendly,
even when he turned them upon the beautiful Arabella.
He had not forgotten—he promised himself
he would never forget—the lure by which the artful
duenna had made him believe that he himself was
the beloved one of the gypsy’s prophecy, for which
the delighted girl had added a gratuity for pure good will.
His cheek burned when he remembered that
Raymond—nay, all the fireside group—had perceived
his agitation, his joyful tremor, yet a degree
of vacillation, and alack, his coxcombical prudery
lest one or the other should openly speak his name.
He recognized the whole of the wily aunt’s scheme
to put it into his mind that if he were not in love
with Arabella he might well be, and was thought to
be. The treacherous anti-climax, by which Arabella
had interfered to spare his blushes,—her protestation
of adoration of the drawing-master who, he was
persuaded, was fictitious,—had a peculiar bitterness
in being deemed a necessity. Yet in thus thwarting
his obvious expectations and self-consciousness he had
been rendered ridiculous in the eyes of Raymond,—who
seemed actually to have the temerity to contemplate
a competition with him for Miss Howard’s
favor,—and openly and signally punished for his self-conceit.
They thought too slightingly of him—to
play with him thus. He was neither to be managed
by the adroit old tactician nor flouted by the imperious
young beauty. He was remembering his
worldly consequence, which he generally had the
magnanimity to forget,—his expectations, as heir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
of his grandfather’s title and estates, for he was the
only son of his father, years ago deceased. He had
summoned all his instinct for the social conventions,
since he was too young to have learned worldly wisdom
from experience, and was very definitely asserting
himself in a restrained and incidental fashion. Under
no coercion would bluster be practicable for his
temperament.</p>

<p>He was talking of himself—of himself, continually,
and Mrs. Annandale beamed upon him with the most
intent solicitude, and Miss Arabella’s charming hazel
eyes expressed a flattering interest. Her pride, too,
had been cut down—was it indeed true that nobody
who was <i>anybody</i> would care for her?</p>

<p>His grandfather was much on his lips to-day—recent
letters had brought the home news; naught
of great moment, he said, eying not the lovely girl
but a clouded cane which he poised with a deft hand,
be-ringed with some costly gauds that he was not wont
to wear. There had been a storm. Some timber was
down in the park. His grandfather grudged every
stick.</p>

<p>“Of course. Trees are such beautiful objects,”
said Arabella, consciously inane, struggling against
an embarrassment induced by his manner and all
unaware of a cause for a change.</p>

<p>“Fairly good-looking, I suppose; but I have seen
several here—in the wilderness. Not a rarity, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you sarcastic boy!” cried Mrs. Annandale,
visibly out of countenance, and sending her niece a
side glance of exhortation and upbraiding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Even the mere outline is fascinating to me,” said
Arabella. “I often spend hours in delineating merely
the tree form in sepia. It is such an apt expression
of the idea of symmetry.”</p>

<p>This was an unhappy reminder of the incident of
the drawing-master. The two ladies were altogether
unperceptive of any subtler significance in the remark,
but with Mervyn it set the recollection rankling
anew.</p>

<p>“For myself, I always thought the park too dense,
except, perhaps, toward the north, but my grandfather
reports to me each tree fallen, as rancorously
as if it were a deserter from the main body.”</p>

<p>“To be sure—to be sure—it will all be yours
one day,” said Mrs. Annandale, clear adrift from her
wonted moorings.</p>

<p>The young man haughtily changed color. “A far
day, I earnestly hope,” he said, gravely. “I never
look to it. I am more than content with my mother’s
little property.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure—to be sure—a handsome provision,”
said Mrs. Annandale, wildly. What was the
matter with the conversation—a murrain on it!—She
could have taken Arabella by her handsome
shoulders and shaken her with a will. Every word
that the girl spoke was a word awry. It did not occur
to her that the interpretation was inimical. As for
herself she incontinently wished that her tongue were
blistered. For Mrs. Annandale had no leniency for
herself unless she were triumphantly demonstrating
her right to consideration. She glanced about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
room nervously for an inspiration. The circle of
great clumsy chairs ranged round the fire, covered
with buffalo robes, were several of them empty—she
might have fared better, perhaps, if “dear Brother,”
with his military bluntness, and the direct glance of
his eye, and his candid habit of mind were ensconced
in one of them—even in her extremity she did not
wish for Raymond as a reinforcement. Her adversity,
she felt, would be that young villain’s opportunity.
But what lacked she herself? What perversity
had metamorphosed this propitious occasion! It
seemed of phenomenal advantage. What more could
she ask! Arabella was lovely in a simple gown of
lilac sarcenet, all sprigged with white violets. Though
the bodice was cut low according to the universal
fashion, her neck was covered by a tucker, as behooved
the day-time, but her shoulders gleamed
through the sheer muslin and the tambour embroidery
with a fascinating fairness and softness,
enhanced by the modesty of the veiling. Her golden
hair was surmounted by a tiny cap of plaited gauze,
also a diurnal adjunct, and her slender slippered feet
rested with dainty incongruousness upon a great
wolf-skin. Her lute, lying in the ample window-seat,
for the logs of the walls were thick, offered no
suggestion.</p>

<p>“The poor lamb would sing off the key in all this
commotion,” thought Mrs. Annandale, venturesome
no more. A rustic table, wrought of twisted grape-vines,
thick as a man’s arm, held the young lady’s
open work-box, full of skeins of silks, and beside it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
her embroidery-frame. On a large and clumsy table
in the centre of the floor was a silver tankard,
emblazoned with the family arms, and a pair of
goblets, showing handsomely on a scarlet blanket
utilized as a table cover, wrought with beads and
porcupine quills, a foot and a half in depth. The
usual frontier decorations on the walls were buffalo
hides, painted in aboriginal art, quivers, blankets,
baskets, Indian head-dresses, and collars of swan’s
feathers, and on the mantel-piece, decorated jugs and
bowls, with Captain Howard’s swords crossed above
them. Still above was a small oval portrait of Arabella
when she was a smiling, rosy infant. Mrs.
Annandale’s hard little eyes softened as they rested
upon it.</p>

<p>This affection for her elder niece was the only proof
that Mrs. Annandale had or had ever had a heart.
Her husband, an ill-advised country squire, who
wanted a clever wife and got her, gave up the enigma
of life and died within the year. The jointure was
the only certain reason why she had married him,
for obviously she had not wanted a clever husband.
But to this motherless niece, her whole nature paid
tribute. She could not be said to soften—for she
grew hard, and keen, and tough in endurance in Arabella’s
interest. The trust which her brother had
confided to her was not misplaced. Her acumen,
her vigilance, her training, all exerted to one end, had
resulted in a charming and finished product of feminine
education. And now the schemer was looking
to the future. The war was over; leave of absence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
was granted in profusion to the officers whose duty
had been so nobly done. George Mervyn at home
would be surrounded with all the match-making wiles
which lure an unexceptionable young man, already
well endowed with this world’s goods and the heir
to a title and a fortune. The gay world would be a
pleasant place for him. He was docile, tractable, and
the delight of his grandsire’s heart, and if the youth
had no special ambitions to gratify in marriage, which
his quiet, priggish, restrained manner seemed to
promise, be sure Sir George Mervyn would not be without
mercenary designs on his account. The old man
would say the boy was good enough, well-born enough,
handsome enough, wealthy enough, to deserve well of
matrimonial fate. He should have a beautiful and
richly dowered bride, and become, with these accessories
of fortune and importance, preëminent among the
magnates of the country-side. Thus Mrs. Annandale
had beheld with prophetic dismay the septuagenarian’s
gallant attentions to Miss Eva Golightly at the
supper-table of the county ball, and thus it was that
she had determined to intercept George Mervyn’s unpledged
heart, still in his own keeping, in the frontier
fastnesses of America. Moreover, Sir George Mervyn,
as tough as one of the English oaks whose downfall
he deplored, was as old in his type of creation—his
downfall as certain. His grandson would one day be
summoned home to assume the title and inherit the
estates, and in the nature of things that day could
not be far distant.</p>

<p>How well the primordium of her schemes had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
fared—the successful journey, the eager welcome,
the ample leisure, all the possibilities that propinquity
might betoken! But suddenly a distortion like the
dislocations of a dream had befallen her symmetrical
plan. The young officer had seemed yesterday the
ingenuous, pliable, confiding youth she remembered
of yore. He had showed her an almost affectionate
respect; for Captain Howard he evidently entertained
a deep regard and appreciation; the beautiful young
lady whom he had last seen as a mere schoolgirl had
roused in him a delighted admiration and an earnest
solicitude to monopolize her society. While to-day
he was haughty, stiff, only conventionally deferential,
disposed to consider himself, and with no inclination
to converse on any other topic.</p>

<p>The pause frightened Mrs. Annandale. It was a
provocation to terminate a formal call. She bolted
at the nearest subject in hand.</p>

<p>“Who is your friend, Mr. Raymond?” she asked.
Then the recollection of the difficulty that had arisen
between the two young men smote her with the aim
of a bolt of lightning.</p>

<p>Mervyn cast a keen glance at her, but she held her
pinched little features well together and gave no
sign. A very small face she had, with but little expression,
and but little was required of it.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard him giving you his autobiography
the other evening,” he said with a formal,
frosty smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, but we need the estimate of a friend to come
at the truest truth,” she opined, sagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“I could add nothing to what he has already said,”
Mervyn replied succinctly. And Mrs. Annandale felt
as if reproved as a gossip, baffled in the hope of
slander, and disregarded as a cynic.</p>

<p>She hardly knew where to turn. In desperation
she gave up the personal conduct of the action.</p>

<p>“Why do you two young people sit moping in the
house this fine day?” she cried. “Arabella, why
don’t you ask Captain Mervyn to take you to walk
on the ramparts? He will not let the cannon bite
you, and the snow is almost gone!”</p>

<p>She glanced at the young officer with her coercive
smile, and certainly he could not refuse. He rose
instantly—“At your service,” he said, turning with
a polite bow to the young lady.</p>

<p>The demonstration certainly had not the eager
enthusiastic urgency with which he had offered to
show her the fort when she first arrived;—it hardly
suggested an appreciation of the prospect of a delightful
walk with a charming young lady, nor
expressed gratitude for an unexpected pleasure and
honor conferred upon him. Mrs. Annandale restrained
her sentiments till the two young people were fairly
out of the house; then her first sensation was one of
rejoicing that the window was so small and the glass
so thick that she might unobserved shake her fist at
him as he walked away.</p>

<p>“I’d like to gnaw your bones,” she said, unaware
how savage she looked. Then she narrowed her eyes
intently to mark if Arabella’s pelisse did not hang
short in the back, much relieved to perceive a moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
later that the suggested calamity was merely the result
of her leaning a trifle forward as she ascended
the ramp of the barbette to reach the level of the
terre-pleine. Mervyn had courteously offered his
hand to assist her.</p>

<p>“Throttle him!” muttered the fierce little duenna.
But the folds of the pelisse swung back in place as
Arabella stood erect on the rampart and looked
about her with interest. A violet-hued cloth was the
fabric of this garment, and it was trimmed about the
edges with a narrow band of swan’s-down. A hood
of like material was on her head, and the glitter of
her golden hair, rolled high, was framed by white
down like some lingering wreath of the snow. It had
indeed disappeared; the ramparts were clear; the
foot-path hard-trodden; the banquettes beside the
parapet, where the soldiers were wont to stand to
fire through loop-holes in the stockade, still dripped,
having been shaded by the high pointed stakes when
the sun shone.</p>

<p>“You can have little view here, except the ulterior
of the fort,” Mervyn said, as they strolled along. So
disillusioned, so disaffected was he that he was quite
open to the fact that a walk with Arabella along the
ramparts was but a device of Mrs. Annandale’s, and
of no interest in itself.</p>

<p>“I have a glimpse of the mountains above the
stockade, and I am breathing the sun, not the fire.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” assented Mervyn. “The sun is a
welcome visitor—a rare honor.”</p>

<p>Arabella had a fair share of pride, of enterprise in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
a way. Too inexperienced to understand her aunt’s
schemes, too affectionate to divine them, she only
realized that this young man was holding his head
higher than became him in her company, and that
her aunt seemed to regard him as somehow rated
superior to her station, and incidentally to her.
She had an aptitude for ascendency—she could not
look up. Her neck, too, was stiff. And she did not
find Mervyn amusing on his pedestal. Moreover, if
he valued his peace he must come down.</p>

<p>“How little did I ever think in England I should
some day walk along the rampart of a fort in America
with you,”—she turned her suave and smiling eyes
upon him, and he almost melted for the nonce.</p>

<p>“None of us can read the future,” he rejoined at
random. And straight the unlucky recollection of
the gypsy’s prophecy smote him anew.</p>

<p>The men in the galleries of the barracks, and others
pitching horse-shoes in lieu of quoits near the stable
precincts, all marked the lady with interest and
admiration, a rare apparition indeed in these far
wilds, and noted without wonder the prideful port of
the captain-lieutenant, in such charming company.</p>

<p>“A-pea-cockin’ along loike a major-general, be-dad!”
the warder in the tower vouchsafed in a
whisper to the sentry below.</p>

<p>She could not account for Mervyn’s lofty and distant
air—he, who used to be, who seemed indeed
but yesterday, an unassertive and modest youth.</p>

<p>“Are there any fish in this river?” she asked as
passing one of the embrasures she saw above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
cannon the steely gleam of the Keowee, stretching
out to the defiles of the mountains, which were splendidly
purple and crowned with opalescent mists that
shimmered with an intense white glister when they
caught the sheen of the westering sun.</p>

<p>“The fish are hardly worth the taking,” he returned,
disparagingly.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the flies I made for you when
you came home that Easter with Cousin Alfred?”
she suggested, glancing up a trifle coyly. He hesitated
to seem ungrateful.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Fine flies—beautiful flies,” he replied
at random, for indeed he had forgotten them,—he
was almost a young man at the time, and had taken
scant note of the little girl yet in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>She was laughing quietly to herself, as she stood
gazing out for a moment on the scene—for she had
made them no flies; they had sought her assistance,
and she had denied them.</p>

<p>“What amusements have they in this country?”
she demanded, as she began to walk on slowly, and
he kept step at her side.</p>

<p>“Well—scalpings, and burnings, and the torture
are the most striking recreations of the country,” he
said, perversely.</p>

<p>“You can’t make me afraid of the Indians,” she
returned, lifting her head proudly, “while my father
is in command.”</p>

<p>He had a sudden appalled realization of the limitations
of the commandant’s power in which she
trusted so implicitly; he was recollecting that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
father’s predecessor in command, Captain Coytmore,
had been treacherously slaughtered by the Cherokees
in a conference at the gate of this fort, within twenty
paces of the spot where she now stood.</p>

<p>“I did not mean to alarm you,” he said hastily.</p>

<p>“I <i>know</i> you didn’t.” She cast on him a look
seeming full of sweet generosity. “You only meant
to be witty.”</p>

<p>“An unappreciated jest. Apparently I did not
succeed.”</p>

<p>“You are not of that caliber,” she suggested.</p>

<p>He was not pleased that she should express her
judgment of his mental endowments. His nerves
were all tense and vibrated with keen dissonance at
every unconsidered touch. Nevertheless it was impossible
not to reply in kindred vein.</p>

<p>“Do you allude to a large or a small caliber?” he
revolted at the question.</p>

<p>“It depends on the charge—too large for some—too
small for others.”</p>

<p>“I feel as if I were guessing riddles,” he said,
floutingly.</p>

<p>“Life is a riddle—a dark riddle, and there is no
answer this side of eternity,” she returned, seriously.</p>

<p>“Now I am hearing a sermon. Do you often
preach?” he asked, mockingly.</p>

<p>“What are they going to do about the dear old
missionary?” she queried, suddenly. “The poor old
man who is risking his life among the Indians to bring
their souls to salvation!”</p>

<p>“The commandant will request him to come down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
here to Fort Prince George, and leave their souls to
their deserts. He is sending a boat up to-morrow. I
think he goes with it to use his influence in person.”</p>

<p>“Papa—is going—” She paused in dismay.</p>

<p>“It is not far; there is no danger for him; he takes
an escort.”</p>

<p>“And he will leave <i>me</i> here?” She spoke tremulously,
half to herself. She could hardly rest without
the sense of the puissant paternal protection.</p>

<p>“His influence at Little Tamotlee is necessary,” explained
Mervyn. “The Indians have great regard for
him. His presence there will avert danger from the
post,—Fort Prince George,—and may actually be
necessary to save the old missionary’s life.”</p>

<p>“Then—who is to be left in command at Fort
Prince George?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I shall be in command here, being next in rank.”</p>

<p>She still paused, facing him as they stood together
on the rampart. She had turned a little pale. The
breeze blowing gently from the shining river ruffled
the tendrils of the hair on her forehead beneath the
white fur of her violet hood and lifted the one long,
soft golden curl that hung between its strings on her
left shoulder. The simple attire, the wistful look,
the doubtful, tremulous pause, made her seem very
young, and appealing, and tender.</p>

<p>“You will be in command?” she repeated, interrogatively.
Then—“Take care of Aunt Claudia,”
she said, urgently. “Take care of—me.”</p>

<p>“I will, indeed,” he cried, heartily, wholly won.
“Trust me, I will indeed!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the rescuing party set forth the following
day, Arabella and her aunt, with much perplexity
and disapproval of frontier methods, watched through
an embrasure on the southern bastion the boats
pulling down the river. The men of the escort were
evidently in the highest spirits; great hilarity prevailed
amongst those warned for duty as they ran to and
fro on the parade and in and out of the barracks,
making their preparations for the expedition. They
were loud of voice, calling directions, suggestions,
admonitions, hither and thither, in clear, resonant
tones; swift of movement, hardly a step taken that
was not at a double-quick. They were notably clean
and dapper of aspect, in their cocked hats, red coats,
long leggings, drawn high over the trousers, and
white cross-belts, glittering from the effects of pipe-clay,
their hair in stiff plaited queues, decorously
powdered.</p>

<p>“And not one of them knows whether he will have
so much as his own scalp to bring home with him, by
the time this fashionable, aboriginal Drum is over,”
remarked Mrs. Annandale. “I always thought that
men are constitutionally knaves, my dear, but I begin
to fear, I greatly fear, they are instead constitutionally
fools.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>They were obviously regarded with envy by their
stay-at-home comrades, and there was a sort of sullen
plaint in the very glance of the eye of the silent
sentinels at their various posts as the details of the
preparations passed within the range of their vision.
The quarter-master-sergeant and the cooks were enjoying
great prominence, and were the centre of much of
the fluster and bustle. The chief of this department,
however, the quarter-master, himself, who conferred
from time to time with Captain Howard, seemed to
harbor the only despondent sentiments entertained
pending the packing. It was necessary to jog his
memory more than once touching supplies that were
more luxuries than necessities, which had been required
by the commandant, and especially was this
the case in regard to the contents of the great budgets
made up for the presents to Tamotlee Town, which
Captain Howard intended to convey with the party.
The quarter-master gave an irritated shake of his big
round head and his big red face, as if this demonstration
were officially necessary to the pained and
reluctant relinquishment of his charge, as he stood in
the precincts of his store-room, a great log building
illumined from a skylight that the walls might be
utilized by shelves from top to bottom, and with
many barrels and boxes and sacks of various commodities
ranged along the floor, narrow aisles permitting
a passage. More than once, the sergeant
and his assistant, both handsomely be-floured and be-sugared
in their haste, fostering awkward handling,
were fain to say—“An’ the terbaccy, sor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Oh, Gad!—as if they didn’t have tobacco of
their own and to spare—” he cried out. Then in a
weakened voice—“How many pounds does the list
call for, Peters?”</p>

<p>“Then the brandied sweetmeats, sor?” The sergeant
made toward a series of jars, brought expressly
for the delectation of the officers and by no means
intended for the rank and file.</p>

<p>“Hell!” The quarter-master squeaked out the
exclamation as if it had laid hold on him and half
choked out his voice. “<i>They</i> ain’t on the list?
Lord! the commandant is clean crazed! The Injuns
have got no palates. They can’t taste.”</p>

<p>The sergeant cocked up a beguiling eye at his
chief and smacked his lips.</p>

<p>“Them brandied cher’s, sor, is sthrong enough, an’
swate enough to make ’em grow a palate a-purpose,”
he said.</p>

<p>“And how do <i>you</i> know?” demanded the quarter-master,
suddenly intent.</p>

<p>“Faix, sor, yez remember that one of the jars was
bruken in onpackin’, an’ only half full. An’ though
Peters said glass wuz pizin, an’ wouldn’t tech ’em—sure,
sor, I thought a man cudn’t die in a sweeter
way!” And once more he smacked his lips.</p>

<p>“There’s a case-bottle of brandy for Rolloweh,”—the
quarter-master’s face fell as he gazed at the
list on the head of a barrel. “Why, ’tis known that
the Injuns will drink pepper vinegar as soon as sherry
wine! And a jug of raspberry shrub—the finest ever
made, I’ll swear. Get ’em out. Get ’em out!”—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
once more he stood over the commodities, and
eyed them funereally, and shook his head in melancholy
farewell.</p>

<p>“And the cheeses, sor. Would ut be convanient
fur yer honor to furgit the cheeses?” suggested the
sergeant with a roguish eye.</p>

<p>“What?—not at all—not at all,” said the quarter-master,
out of countenance, nevertheless.</p>

<p>“Thin, sor, if yez be aimin’ to presarve yer memory,
there’s a box o’ snuff—fine Rappee—at the top of
the list, passed by.”</p>

<p>“Get it out! Get it out!” said the quarter-master,
pacing back and forth, as if preoccupied, in
the narrow aisle between the baled goods, his red face
grave and bent, his portly figure erect, his hands
clasped behind him, with the list held carelessly in his
fingers.</p>

<p>“I’ll engage the commandant niver thinks how low
the sthore is running,” suggested the sergeant.</p>

<p>“And if we get out—out we will be; for the
government will send no more goods here, and we
just awaiting orders to evacuate and march for
Charlestown. Have you finished—the order filled?
Then call the boat’s crew and get it aboard.”</p>

<p>They were embarked at last, the oars striking the
water with a masterful impact, the boats then skimming
off like a covey of birds with wings spread.
There went first the commandant and his escort,
followed by the pettiaugre laden with the necessaries
for the expedition, and lastly by the Indian delegation,
who had come afoot of their own motion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
were now going back at the expense of Fort Prince
George with transportation furnished. Very drunk
several of them were, all a trifle unsteadied by the
signal success of their mission, and the fervor of the
hospitality of Fort Prince George. To their own
place in his estimation they ascribed Captain Howard’s
instant concession to their demand, the compliment
of his official presence on this mission, their return to
their confrères in this triumphant state, and they
pridefully interpreted the desire of the government
to preserve the peace as fear still entertained of the
prowess of the Indian. They took no heed of
the commandant’s solicitude for the life of the old
missionary.</p>

<p>Captain Howard felt justified in bestirring himself
smartly for the rescue of the old man.</p>

<p>“It is for the obvious good of the frontier and in
the interest of the government, for one murder now
would be the precursor of an outbreak,” he had said
in a council of the officers summoned the previous
morning; “and I am glad that it is thus, for I cannot
in conscience, in humanity, leave the old missionary
to his horrible fate. The thought would not let me
sleep a wink last night.”</p>

<p>He was cheerful and hilarious now as he sat in the
stern, listening to the orders to the crews. The
voices carried far on the water, echoed by the crags
on either bank, then striking back from the foothills
of the mountains, which were marshalled in close
defiles on each side further and further along the
reaches of the river. He took scant notice of other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
echoes—the mouthings and mockings of young
braves of the Indian town of Keowee on the opposite
bank, as they ran glibly along in a line with the
craft, yelling in their broken English,—“Let fall!—Give
way!—Back oars!—Keep stroke!” as the
orders successively rang over the water.</p>

<p>On shore to the two watching women on the bastion,
gazing through the embrasure, this demonstration
seemed queerly rancorous, and as inimical as uncouth.
They noted that the delegation in the boat, who
had been so honored, so generously entreated, took
up the fantastic flout and continued it even after the
mockings from along shore had flagged and failed.
When the crew of soldiers began to sing, after the
time-honored custom of the pettiaugre afloat, and the
crude young voices rang out not inharmoniously in a
strong and hearty chorus, the Indian guests interpolated
derisive comments as they followed—now
a short howl, now a cry of <i>Hala! Hala!</i> now a
bleat, as of sheep, now the crowing of cocks—a
raillery little suggestive of mirth or rollicking good-humor.
The soldiers seemed as disregardful as if
they did not hear, and bent to the oars with a will.
The commandant never turned his head. But his
sister and daughter looked at each other with an
aghast questioning stare, to which neither could suggest
a consolatory response.</p>

<p>Arabella seemed all the more slender and willowy
in her long violet pelisse, with its edge of soft white
down, as she stood beside the little lady, who was
bundled in a thick coat of gray, lined and bordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
with squirrel fur. She had a great calash to match,
and as she peered out with her preternaturally sharp
eyes with their furtive glance, she looked not unlike
some keen little animal of no great strength, perhaps,
but capable of some sharp exploit of mischief.</p>

<p>The craft of the expedition became visible once
more far across the wooded spur of a hill which the
steely river rounded. The sun on the stream was so
bright that the three boats, skimming the dazzling
surface, seemed as if they were airily afloat on floods
of light instead of the denser medium of water. Still
the singing sounded, richly, still the echoes answered
clear, and once and again the harsh note of derision
marred the harmony. Then they were gone, and
the woods were silent. The fragment of a stave—a
hesitant echo—the vague impact of an oar on
water—! No more.</p>

<p>“They are gone!” said Arabella, turning to her
aunt, a sort of desolation in her fair young face.</p>

<p>“Yes—I don’t see them now.” Mrs. Annandale
had already turned to descend the ramp, and the
captain-lieutenant remembered with a start to offer
her his hand. He himself filled now the field of
vision of the little schemer, though he had only eyes
for Arabella. She came lightly down the steep
incline without assistance, and once more he noted
the pallid suspense in her face, the dilation of anxiety
in her beautiful eyes. He had long ago been inured
to the fierce suspense of frontier life, but he appreciated
that to her untried heart it had all the poignancy
of a realized grief. He sought to divert her attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“I have a favor to ask of you, ladies.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale paused as she trudged stoutly
along on the miry ground and glanced up keenly
from out her fur.</p>

<p>“An invitation to dine and spend the evening with
you,” he continued.</p>

<p>The old lady, a benign glow stirring in her stanch
heart, had yet the tact to plod silently for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>“You want to see how dull an evening can be—for
we are in no case to be merry,” she said.</p>

<p>“I want to show you how we spend the intervals
of suspense on the frontier—how we pass the time
as best we may—and hold up our hearts.”</p>

<p>“But we did not bargain for this—for suspense—on
the frontier,” plained Arabella. “Did we, Aunt
Claudia?”</p>

<p>The fur head of the little animal in advance wagged
in earnest corroboration. “They told me the war
was over,” she said, without turning, “—and <i>me</i>—so
timid!”</p>

<p>“You have nothing but your unfounded fears to
frighten you,” he urged. “There is no danger—nothing
to frighten you—nothing threatening. You are
not used to the manners of the Indians, that is all!”</p>

<p>“Manners! they have no manners, drat ’m!”
exclaimed Mrs. Annandale, remembering the marred
melody of the boat-song.</p>

<p>“You have not been here to agonize over Captain
Howard even when there was real war,” he persisted.</p>

<p>“Ah, but we couldn’t realize how strange—how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
uncertain—how dangerous, till we see something of
it!” Arabella declared.</p>

<p>“You see nothing of it—this is absolutely nothing.”</p>

<p>“Why, I tremble to think even of the others,”
said Arabella, and Mrs. Annandale had a sudden
recollection of the distant figure of Raymond in a
gallant pose as he stood in the bow of the foremost
boat, taking off his cocked hat and bowing low to
Arabella as he glimpsed her standing by the cannon
at the embrasure, while the boat passed slowly beyond
the range of the bastion.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—and that dear good man, the missionary.
When the Reverend Mr. Morton comes to
Fort Prince George, precious love, you must embroider
for him a sermon-case or a silk poor-bag.”</p>

<p>“I fancy a man who wants to save Indians’ souls
doesn’t care for gauds of embroidery, and the poor
don’t get much comfort from a fine silk bag,” said
Arabella, with sudden contumacy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale swiftly put her in the wrong.</p>

<p>“Oh, my own, don’t reflect on the minister for trying
to save the souls of Indians. God made them,
child, God made them. Humanly speaking, He might
have done better. But everything has a purpose.
Perhaps Providence created them with souls, and no
manners, to give the Mr. Mortons of this life something
to do, to keep them going up and down in the waste
places where the Indians are safely out of sight of
civilized people—except fools who journey from London
to see how near they can come to being scalped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
without losing hair or hide. Oh, no, my dear; realize
human limitations and never, <i>never</i> reflect on the
purposes of creation.”</p>

<p>Mervyn, noticing the frowning cogitation on Arabella’s
fair brow as she listened, interposed in his own
interest—“All this is aside from the question.
May I come in to dinner?”</p>

<p>Once again Mrs. Annandale vacillated, and Arabella,
marking her hesitation, was a little ashamed of
a suspicion she had entertained. She had fancied
that, although her aunt had said that Mervyn was
far too highly placed and too richly endowed with
worldly goods to make a possible parti for her, there
had been some scheme in Mrs. Annandale’s mind,
nevertheless, to try for his capture. Now as he fairly
begged for an hour of her society the old lady
doubted, and hesitated, and was hardly hospitable
to her old friend’s grandson and her neighbor. She
even began to make terms with him.</p>

<p>“You won’t want to fetch over with you any of the
villains at the mess-hall? For I don’t know what is
the state of the larder—or if we have <i>anything</i> to
eat.”</p>

<p>“No—no, only myself, madam. And I’ll bring
my own dinner, if you like.”</p>

<p>“What have you got for dinner?” Mrs. Annandale
asked as she stood on the step of the commandant’s
quarters, and looked over her shoulder with a benign
jocosity.</p>

<p>“The finest trout you ever tasted, madam,” he
protested. “Do let me send them in to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“I thought you said yesterday that the fish in this
river are hardly worth the taking,” the young lady
interrupted, surprised.</p>

<p>Mervyn colored a trifle, remembering his perversity
during the morning walk of the day before.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was sad—and rather bad,” he remarked.</p>

<p>Her aunt had disappeared within, and she put her
foot on the step where her relative had just stood.
It brought her face almost on a level with his, and the
gaze of her beautiful eyes at these close quarters was
rather bewildering.</p>

<p>“It is very bad for you to be sad,” she said softly,
and his heart beat so fast and so loud that he feared
she might hear it. “And it is very sad for you to
be bad,” she stipulated, and went smiling into the
house with a languid relish of her jest.</p>

<p>He followed into the parlor, begging Mrs. Annandale
for the coveted invitation, protesting that what
he wanted was a bit of talk to keep them all from
being lonely, and—with a glance at the lute on the
window-seat—to hear the new songs they were
singing at Vauxhall Gardens and Ranelagh, and to
hear the old songs that Arabella used to sing down in
Kent. Might he come? And might he send the
fish?</p>

<p>“No supper—no song,” Mrs. Annandale at last
assented, and Mervyn went off in a glow of happiness
to confer cautiously with the officer of the day, to
order the great gate closed, to himself inspect the
guard and visit each sentinel, to climb to the warder’s
tower and thence gaze over the great spaces of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
picturesque country—the stretches of mountains
looming purple and dark, save where the residuum
of snow still glimmered in a deep ravine, the river
between the silent hills, the fluctuating lights of
Keowee Town on the opposite side of the stream, and
the stars whitely a-gleam in the great concave of the
sky, all clear, save to the west, where a dark cloud,
voluminous, of variant degrees of density and with
flocculent white verges, was slowly rising above the
horizon. It held rain—mayhap wind. It would
strike the rescue expedition before it would reach
Fort Prince George. But Mervyn’s interests were
within the work. He personally looked to every precaution
for its safety before, arrayed anew with great
particularity, he repaired to the commandant’s
quarters, whither his dish of fish had preceded him.</p>

<p>Arabella, sick at heart, nervous and anxious, sitting
in her own room with her aunt before the wood fire,
with every detail of its scant and simple furnishings
reminding her of the love and care of her father and
his thought and devices with such meagre materials
for her comfort,—the rose-tinted hangings, the large
mirror, so difficult to transport through the wilderness,
the chairs and tables, each constructed by his
orders,—felt that she could hardly support the ordeal
of an evening with a stranger—at least a comparative
stranger. She wished the occasion to be one
of scant ceremony. She said to her aunt that she
intended to appear in the dress she had worn
throughout the day.</p>

<p>“I have no mind for bedizenment and festivity,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
she complained. “My head aches. I can hear those
savage yells every time I listen.”</p>

<p>“Then—don’t listen,” interpolated her aunt.</p>

<p>“And I can see—” she pressed her hands to her
eyes—“can see those boats pushing out from the
shore—taking the soldiers off into the shining water—who
knows where!”</p>

<p>“They tell me the town’s fiendish name is Little
Tamotlee,” put in Mrs. Annandale.</p>

<p>“I can see the first pettiaugre with my father in
the stern and Ensign Raymond standing in the prow,
and waving his hat to me and—”</p>

<p>“Captain Howard is able to take care of himself,”
Mrs. Annandale interrupted hastily, “and if Ensign
Raymond is not—so much the worse for him!
Has that besom laid out my frock yet?” She lifted
her voice for the edification of Norah in the outer
room.</p>

<p>“And you will excuse me, Aunt, if I don’t change
my dress?” Arabella said, plaintively.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it would hurt the young man’s
feelings,” Mrs. Annandale affected to consider. “He
is too sodden in pride—those Mervyns all are. I
suppose he <i>might</i> think, as we are so poor, that you
have but a frock or two. Well, it is none of <i>his</i> business
how little money Captain Howard can spare for
your maintenance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Claudia!” cried Arabella, genuinely
offended—“if you think <i>that</i>!—And what are you
wearing? Your murrey-colored satin?”</p>

<p>Thus it was that the young lady was resplendent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
in silver-shot gray paduasoy, shoaling and shimmering
with white lights, made with short puffed sleeves
slashed with cerise velvet, and she wore a fillet of
cerise velvet in her golden hair. A delicate fichu of
filmy Mechlin lace was draped over her shining neck
and was caught with shoulder-knots of cerise velvet.
She cast a very imperious glance upon Mervyn as
she entered the parlor, which challenged his homage,
but she had no need to assert her pride, for he was
again in his old docile character, assuming naught of
pre-eminence because of his worldly advantages, satisfied
to bask in her smiles, yet a trifle conscious of
his personal endowments, and carrying himself with a
species of gallant self-confidence not displeasing in a
handsome youth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Captain Howard’s faithful belief that a good
cook was as important to the commander of a garrison
as an efficient fort-adjutant. The soup was redolent
of sherry; the trout had been prepared with an earnest
solicitude that might be accounted prayer, and
made a fine show arranged on a bed of water-cress
that had sprouted before the late snows; the lamb, a
rarity on the frontier, sent up an aromatic incense of
mint sauce. All the brandied cherries had not gone
as gifts to the Indians. A tart of preserved fruits,
served with cream from a cherished cow, found friends
all around the board; and a charming dish of Floating
Island was so submerged in brandy that Mrs.
Annandale opined it might be called—“Half seas
over.”</p>

<p>One might not have divined that Mrs. Annandale’s
sharp truculence in orders and admonitions had
added wings to the swiftness of the cook and roused
him to accomplish his utmost. She looked suave
and benign as she presided in festival array over the
feast that did the quarters so much honor. All was
jollity and genial good fellowship as the three ranged
themselves around the table. The two tall silver
candle-sticks, with their wax candles, lighted up
smiling faces as they looked at one another across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
well-spread board, which so definitely belied Mrs.
Annandale’s pretended solicitude for the state of the
commandant’s larder.</p>

<p>There was something singularly home-like in the
informal little feast, and it appealed gratefully to the
sentiment of the young soldier who had seen naught
of home for three long years. He laughed at Mrs.
Annandale’s sallies and made bold to fling them back
at her. He explained with long-winded and eager
diligence all frontier conditions that seemed to impress
Arabella. He talked of his immediate future
after his return to England, his plans for the next
few years, with an intimate expectation of their responsive
interest which sent a glow to the pallid cheek
of the wily tactician, for it was as if in his anticipation
they shared in these events. She doubted if Arabella
perceived this collocation of his ideas—she was sure
that he was not aware how definitely he had expressed
them to her intuitive comprehension. But she could
piece together the thought in his mind with the suggestion
in his speech, and the coherence combined in
the augury of the fulfilment of her dearest dream.
They sat long at table; the candles had burned so
low that Mrs. Annandale was fain to cock her head like
a sparrow as she peeped around the blaze.</p>

<p>“My certie,” she exclaimed at last, “you cannot
sit till midnight over your bottle when you come to
dine with two lone lorn women. Clear away the dishes,
man—” (this to the servant), “and don’t let them
clatter, if you want whole bones.”</p>

<p>And when they were all gone,—disappearing as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
silently as crockery could,—and the three were
about the fire once more, the lute was brought, and
Arabella sang the songs of home to the exiles.
Out at the door the sentinel, always posted at the
commanding officer’s quarters, paused on his beat and
stood still to listen, spell-bound. The grand rounds,
returning along the ramparts, slackened their march
to hear the tinkling vibrations and the dulcet, romantic,
melancholy voice, that seemed somehow of kinship
with the moonlight, a-glimmer outside, on the
great bastion; with the loneliness of the vast wilderness;
with the vague lilting rune of the river; with the
mournful undertone of the wind, rising in the distance.</p>

<p>George Mervyn felt at the blissful portal of an
earthly paradise, as yet too sacred to enter, but in
his tremors, his delighted expectancy, his tender
visions, there was no stir of doubt. He felt her demand
of homage; more than once this day he had
been sensible of her power intentionally exerted upon
him. She desired him to fall at her feet. Now and
again her eyes warned him that he should not think
less of her than her large meed. And then the wistful
sweetness when she had besought his care! It was
hers—it should be hers for life! There seemed even
now but a word to speak between them. He watched
her as she sat glimmering in silver and white, half in
the shadow, half in the light, the lute in her hand,
her graceful head and neck bent forward, her eyes
on the fire. The song ended; the strings ceased to
vibrate; the echo stirred and failed and there was a
long pause, while the firelight flashed, and the walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
glowed, and the white feathery ash shifted lightly in
the stronger draught of the fire, for the wind was rushing
in at the crevices of the window, drawing with the
heated air up the great chimney. The sentinels as
they walked their beats outside noted its gathering
strength, and glanced from time to time toward the
sky, mindful of the sombre, fateful portent of the great
cloud in the west that now reached near the zenith,
the moonlight showing the tumult and trouble of
its convolutions, its densities, its cavernous recesses,
the subtleties of the variations of its shoaling tints,
from the deepest purple through all the gamut of
color to the edges of glistening gray.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a deafening crash. A vivid
white flash flickered through the room. The next
moment the loud rote of the echoes of the thunder
was reverberating through the mountain defiles; the
surging of the wind sounded like the engulfing turmoils
of a tidal wave, and the rain beat tumultuously
on the roof.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale, all unaware of the coming tempest,
by reason of the curtained window and her own
absorptions, sprang to her feet with a wild little cry
of blended terror and temper, and Arabella, pressing
her hands to her eyes, let the lute slip from her lap
to the floor, where its impact sent out a hollow dissonance.
Mervyn had stooped to pick it up when
Mrs. Annandale clutched him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me a storm was coming?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>“Dear madam, I did not know it myself,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Mervyn, gently, yet nevertheless constrained to smile.
So does a superiority to the fears of others elate the
soul that he did not even shrink from the claw-like
grip that the skinny fingers of the little woman was
making felt even among the tough muscles of his stalwart
arm. “Believe me, there is no danger.”</p>

<p>He spoke in the random way in which men see fit
to reassure a terrified woman or child. Seldom is the
insincerity of this haphazard benevolence so signally
exposed as in the next moment when an insupportable,
white, sinister brilliance filled the room, a terrific
crash stunned their ears, and the ashes and coals
from the fireplace were scattered in showers about
the apartment, the bolt evidently having struck the
chimney.</p>

<p>“Oh!—oh!—you wicked man!—(where’s my
sal volatile!) to mislead your old friend and neighbor!
No danger! No danger! Why, the powers of the
air cried out upon your deceits!” she exclaimed,
between sniffs at the hartshorn in a little gilded bottle
that hung from a chain about her waist.</p>

<p>There seemed a vast incongruity between Mervyn’s
mild short-comings and the tumultuous rebukes of
the thunder as it rolled about the house. Despite
his duplicity he was esteemed by the old lady the most
reliable support attainable against the anger of the
elements, and she clung to one arm, while he held the
lute in the other hand. As he turned to note how far
the coals had been scattered on the puncheons, the
instrument struck the back of a chair and the blow
elicited a plaintive susurrus of protest. At the unexpected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
sound Mrs. Annandale gave a galvanic start
so violent that it seemed as if it might have dislocated
every bone in her body.</p>

<p>“Man alive!” she exclaimed, irritably, upon observing
the cause of the sound, “put the dratted thing
down—somewhere—anywhere! Do you think this
is a time to go perking and majoring around, like a
troubadour!”</p>

<p>One might have thought the lute was hot, so quickly
did Mervyn let it slide upon the table. Then with
a certain air of importance, for he was not accustomed
to be rated in this tone, and infinitely did
he deprecate ridicule in the presence of Arabella, he
said, “Let me conduct you to a chair, Mrs. Annandale;
you would be more comfortable seated.”</p>

<p>Despite her nerves and terror the little lady detected
the change in his tone, and made haste to insinuate
her apology.</p>

<p>“Oh, child—child!” she said, gazing up artfully
at him. “You do not know what it is to be afraid—you
are the very spirit and frame of a soldier!
But me—Lord!—I <i>am</i> so timid!”</p>

<p>And with another flash and crash she clung to him
anew.</p>

<p>As far as a mere matter of good-nature might go,
Mervyn would not have hesitated to sacrifice his
comfort or pleasure to the terrors with which he could
not sympathize; he would have permitted her indefinitely
whatever solace she derived from her
painful grip upon his arm. But he had become
alert to the idea of ridicule. He was aware that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
cut a farcical figure as he stood in the pronounced
elegance of his attire,—his brilliant gold-laced uniform,
his powdered hair, the delicate, costly lace at
throat and wrist, his silk stockings and gold-buckled
shoes,—in the custody of the ancient lady, clinging
frantically to his arm, and berating him as she would.
At all events he had been subjected to the situation
in Arabella’s presence as long as he had a mind to
endure it. Mrs. Annandale felt very definitely the
firmness of his intention under the gentle touch as
he contrived to unloose her clutch, and holding the
tips of her fingers with a courtly gesture he led her
across the room and to a seat. She sank down with a
sense of luxury amidst the soft folds of the buffalo
rug that covered it, but she relinquished his arm
reluctantly. She felt the need of something alive
to cling to—a fold of the buffalo rug did not answer;
something to clutch that could tingle and respond
with sympathy. Suddenly she caught at the chain
that hung from her waist and supported her fan, her
pomander-box, and a bunch of trinkets of more or
less utility, and sounded a silver whistle—a dulcet,
seductive tone all incongruous with the service to
which it summoned. This man was no better than
a lay-figure, she said scornfully within herself,—a
mere bit of padding, tricked out in the latest military
style! He hadn’t enough mortality about him
to feel the electric thrills in the air. He could not
hear the thunder, he could not see the lightning,—and
for her own part she wished it might strike close
enough to tickle him, and to tickle him well, provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
of course it tickled no one else. She wanted her
maid; she wanted Norah; who was here on the instant
at the door, with very big eyes and red cheeks, smart
enough, too, with a blue dimity gown and white cap
and apron.</p>

<p>“And why are you genuflecting there at the door,
you vixen?” cried the irate lady, as the girl reached
her side. “Waiting to see me struck by lightning,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sure, mem. God is good!” volunteered
the girl, reassuringly.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mrs. Annandale, fairly rebuked. “Oh—ah—He
has that reputation, to be sure!” Then
recovering herself and mindful of the presence of
Mervyn: “And remember, girl, nobody but the sinner
ever doubts it—the depraved sinner! Never—<i>never</i>
let me hear of your doubting it!”</p>

<p>She tossed up her chin with her head-dress aloft
with something of a pose, as if she herself had preached
the little sermon. Then she turned smoothly to
Mervyn, with her best airy grace somewhat shivered
as she quaked before inconsiderable flashes of lightning—“If
you will excuse me I will return, after
taking a dose of that Indian remedy for the nerves
which was recommended so highly to dear Brother.”</p>

<p>Mervyn, remembering the curious knowledge of
toxicology which the Indians possessed and their
extraordinary skill in distilling vegetable poisons,
ventured to remonstrate.</p>

<p>“Dear madam,” he said, still standing beside the
table where he was waiting to hand her to the door,
“have a care what you drink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“I might say that to you—if the decanter were
on the table,” she retorted, with her customary sparkle
and smile, which a sudden flash distorted into
a grimace before she had finished speaking.</p>

<p>“True,—only too true, and especially on the
frontier,” assented Mervyn, showing his susceptibility
to her pleasantry by a formal smile, something
really in the manner of the lay-figure, “but
some acquaintance with the herbal remedies is essential
to safety, and—pardon me—the only Indian
remedy that Captain Howard uses is bullets.”</p>

<p>“For his own nerves—” began the lady.</p>

<p>“The decanter,”—Mervyn laughed, a trifle abashed.</p>

<p>“Dear Aunt,” Arabella struck in, somewhat alarmed,
“pray be careful.”</p>

<p>She had been standing most of the time since the
tempest began to rage, one hand resting on the back
of the chair beside her, the other lifted to the high
mantel-piece. Her face was pale and grave, now
and then she shuddered at the sinister white glister
of the lightning. She looked tall and stately in her
silver-shotted shoaling gray silk, glimmering in the
shadow and sheen of the fire, and now and then of
a transcendent dazzling whiteness in the fugitive
flashes of the lightning. Mervyn had longed to reassure
her with a word, a look, for he divined her
fright, and even—so does love extend the sympathies—the
nervous shock that the mere flarings
and uproar of the tempest must inflict on more
delicate sensibilities than those of a frontier soldier,
but Mrs. Annandale’s demands upon his attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
had absorbed his every faculty. His heart melted
within him at her next words.</p>

<p>“Pray,—pray, dear Aunt, do be careful. Listen
to Mr. Mervyn.”</p>

<p>“Listen to him yourself!” cried the old lady, who
hardly for her life could have forborne the quip
and the confusion it occasioned her niece. It gave
less point to the moment when she flustered out of
the room, and Mervyn, hastily bestirring himself
to hand her to the door which her maid ran to open,
turned with a sense of infinite relief toward the fire.</p>

<p>He wondered at himself afterward. He knew that
he had but a moment; that Arabella’s poise was
already shaken by the events of the evening; that
there were days to come when occasion would offer
a more propitious opportunity for solitude <i>à deux</i>.
He could not resist her aspect; he could no longer
deny himself the bliss of merging expectation in
certainty.</p>

<p>He crossed the hearth and stood by her side. He
saw the surprise in her eyes; the flush flutter in her
cheek; the tense lifting of her figure into an added
stateliness, an obvious pride. She looked a very
queen as she turned her head—and after all, he was
the suitor.</p>

<p>“And will you listen?”—he said, catching the
phrase. “Will you let me tell you how I worship
you—how I worship you, how every glance of your
eye and every turn of your head and every intonation
of your voice is almost sacred to me? It hardly seems
a sacrilege to say I could fall at your feet and adore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
you. And will you look kindly on my suit? And
will you hear my humble prayer? And will you
reward my devotion? Will you be my wife?”</p>

<p>He had acquitted himself very prettily, and with
a rare interpretation of her state of mind. She had
begun to like him well, but it was not enough that
she should like him. His phrase-making fed her
pride. He had much to offer, and he offered his
abundance in great abasement.</p>

<p>As she slowly lifted her eyes they met his; and he
went on without waiting for a reply. “I wonder at
my courage in speaking at all,” he said. “It seems
impossible that you should care—or that you should
come in time to care for me.”</p>

<p>He paused, and in the tenseness of the silence the
beat of the rain on the roof had an inimical suggestion
as if in its turbulence it might come flying in at them.
The thunder rolled and the echoes followed with
hollow reverberations hardly less resonant. The
lightnings flickered over her face and figure, and she
visibly quailed a little, and he drew nearer.</p>

<p>“When you asked me to take care of you—the
other day—I could scarcely keep from begging for
that privilege forever. It would be my blessed and
sacred duty—it would be my life’s crown. No
behest on earth can be so dear to me as those words.
But let it be forever.”</p>

<p>There was continued silence.</p>

<p>“You will speak to me,” he said with feeling.</p>

<p>She turned her fan in her hand—she was agitated,
but inscrutable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“I know you so little,” she faltered, and he was
sensible of a sudden reaction of the heart; he had
been chilled by the fear that she might actually
refuse.</p>

<p>“And I am glad of that,” he said heartily, and
with a cheery intonation. “While there is nothing
in my experience that is dishonorable, still I feel
so unworthy of you that I am glad to have the chance
of building myself up into something better than I
have been, for you to learn to know. I love you for
what you are, but I want you to love me for what
I shall be for your dear sake.” His words were enthusiastic,
his heart beat fast, his face flushed with
eager expectation.</p>

<p>It was impossible not to be flattered. “Nobody
that was <i>anybody</i>,” quotha! “He held himself
so high! So far,” forsooth, “above a girl without
fortune,” the good duenna had said!</p>

<p>Arabella’s pride had stormed the citadel, albeit his
own fancy had made the breach. Her pride shone in
her eyes, held her head aloft, flushed her fair, meditative,
dignified face. He thought with exultation
how she would grace all he had to bestow—more—far
more.</p>

<p>“My love,” he almost whispered, “I wish I had a
crown to lay at your feet; you look like a queen.”</p>

<p>She burst out laughing with pleasure, declaring
that Love was indeed a villainous hood-winker, that
he should be thus blinded to the aspect of a girl whom
he had known all her life, and whom he was now
minded to fancy a goddess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“No fancy—no fancy—it is the truth—the
eternal truth!”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—tell the truth,” Mrs. Annandale
cried, catching the last word as she entered the
room.</p>

<p>“Tell the truth while you can—while you are
young. For when you are old your conscience is
stiff and you can’t. Well, the marplot storm is
almost over, and I suppose we may deal the cards
for ‘three-handed Ombre.’”</p>

<p>She noticed—for what could escape her keen
glance—that the young officer, though embarrassed
and agitated, had an elated aspect, and the girl’s
stately carriage impressed her. “<i>My lady</i>, that is
to be!” she thought, with a glow of triumph. “And
yet I departed this place only some three minutes
and a half ago.”</p>

<p>Still the thunder rolled, but further and further
and further away, and only the echoes were near—from
the rocks of the neighboring river-banks, the
mountains, and the foothills hard by. Still the lightning
flashed, now in broad sheets, and now in long
zigzag streaks beyond the eastern woods. The tempest
had passed over, and the moon was struggling
through the rack, now seeming on the crest of waves,
again lying in the trough of tossing clouds, like some
beaten and buffeted barque, resigned to fate, and
riding out the storm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale, seated at the table, glancing
over the top of her cards, was annoyed to perceive
Norah genuflecting at the door to the inner apartment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
now opening it a bit, and as she caught the
eye of her irate mistress, closing it hastily.</p>

<p>“You baggage!” called out Mrs. Annandale, with
such sudden sharpness that Mervyn, notwithstanding
his cast-iron nerves, started as if he had been shot.
The door closed instanter, tight and fast, and Norah,
leaning against it outside, had the strength to hope
that her last hour had not come. “What ails that
girl? Are you bewitched, you hussy?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she wants something,” suggested Arabella,
whose loyal temperament seldom made question
of her aunt’s right to her peculiarities; but she
was somewhat ashamed of their exhibition to-night—to-night,
when she was both proud and happy.</p>

<p>“No, Miss, sit you still. By the time you and
George Mervyn would be through with all your
bowings, and counter-bowings, and minuet-ings,
and handing each other to the door, the besom
would have forgot what she wants, or would have
run a mile for fear of me. Come in, girl, and speak
up. Sure, I’ve no secrets to keep. Now, minx,
what have you to say to this worshipful company?”</p>

<p>Norah, red, miserable, and embarrassed, emerged
from the door and stood dropping courtesies of
humble placation and twisting with a gesture of
apology one corner of her apron between her fingers.</p>

<p>“Please, mem,” she said, “I do be hearing that
same knocking what went on bangin’ an’ bangin’
in the storm, at the dure agin.”</p>

<p>“You ninny!” exclaimed Mrs. Annandale, in scorn.
“Do you know that in these colonies they burn folks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
alive for hearing what they can’t hear and seeing
what is not to be seen?”</p>

<p>The girl, looking thoroughly wretched, emitted a
short, sharp squeal of dismay that she tried a moment
afterward to retrieve as a cough.</p>

<p>Mervyn had all an officer’s aversion to familiarity
with inferiors in rank, but as Arabella leaned back
in her chair to be out of her aunt’s range of vision,
and gazed smilingly, reassuringly, at the maid,
blithely shaking her head the while, he thought her
as kind as she was lovely, and benignly watched the
restoration of Norah’s composure.</p>

<p>“Sure, mem, all the time I did hear ut I tould yez
av ut incessant, an’ yez thought ’twuz but the thunder,
an’ the wind, an’ the rain. But now, mem, it’s
at the dure agin, fit to break it in, an’ onst at that
low windy some man climbed up, an’ knocked, he
did, with his knuckles on the glass.”</p>

<p>In the moment’s silence that followed her words
the sullen sound of a repeated knocking at the outer
door was obvious. Mervyn suddenly rose, throwing
his cards down upon the table, and dashed through
the hallway to the outer door.</p>

<p>“Indians! Indians!” quavered Mrs. Annandale,
in a paroxysm of terror. “Indians, I’ll wager!
Cherokees! Chickasaws, and those devils that wear
nose-rings—oh-h-h! and <i>me</i>—so timid!”</p>

<p>Then she said something that Arabella did not
understand, and only remembered long afterward.</p>

<p>“We might have caught this bird in England.
There was no need to lime a twig for him! Oh—why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
did I come, and leave my good home—and
journey over that nasty smelly ocean to this queer
distracted country! Indians! Indians! Indians!”
she continued to quaver, rocking herself back and
forth, and Norah, flying to her side for protection,
knelt at her knee and mechanically repeated the word—Indians!
Indians! as if it were the response of
some curious liturgy they had picked up in their
travels.</p>

<p>Arabella snatched a blunderbuss of her father’s
that swung above the mantel-piece and pressed forward
into the hall to make sure what disaster had
befallen them.</p>

<p>The outer door was open, and the wind still blowing
steadily, had extinguished the lamp. Without
there was more light than within. She could see
the glistening surface of the parade in the moonbeams,
shining like darkly lustrous glass with the rainfall,
and beyond, the guard-house, near the gate. Its
door stood broadly aflare, and the yellow radiance
of the firelight fell on the sodden and soaked ground.
But what surprised her at this hour was the number
of figures astir.—Could there really be a demonstration
of the Cherokees impending? she wondered,
with a clutch of fear at the heart, hearing always
the ominous chant from within—“Indians—Indians!”
as mistress and maid swayed in unison.
She knew it behooved the rank and file to be in barracks
and in bed at this hour. She glanced toward
the long, low building where the soldiers were quartered.
To her surprise the lanterns, swinging in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
galleries, showed the doors were open; figures were
going in and coming out. Then she observed that
they moved slowly and at their ease, loungingly, and
there seemed to be much loud but unexcited talk
amongst them, continuous, as of the details of individual
experience. Whatever the sensation had
been it was obviously spent now. And thus she
marked the conversation at the door.</p>

<p>Mervyn stood on the threshold, and on the step
below a non-commissioned officer was punctiliously
saluting, his attitude, his uniform, his face, rendered
visible by the lantern which one of two soldiers
held.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Jerrold’s compliments, sir, hand Hi
was to hinform you, sir, that the fire is hout.”</p>

<p>“Fire! what fire?” exclaimed Mervyn, wildly,
looking out in keen anxiety, as if he expected to see
the substantial block-houses, the store-house, the
armory, the guard-house, the barracks all vanish
like a mirage. The wind tossed his hair, dispersing
its perfumed powder backward through the hall,
where Arabella scented the fragrance of attar of roses
blended with the dank odors of the rain-drenched
woods.</p>

<p>“Sure, sir, the granary. The lightning struck it
fust volley, and it was blazing like a puffick pyr’mid
in ten seconds.”</p>

<p>“The granary! Damme! Why was I not informed?”</p>

<p>“Sure, sir, the hofficer of the day sent a detail
’ere, sir, to hammer on the door, but they got no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
answer, an’ the fire ’ad to be fit with all ’ands, sir.
Lieutenant Jerrold ’ad ’is fears for the fort.”</p>

<p>Mervyn, all unmindful of the dank, wintry air that
played round his legs, inadequately protected in
silk hose and pumps, felt as if he could faint. The
garrison had fought out its battle for the very existence
of the little frontier fort, and he, the acting
commandant, tucked away in a lady’s bower, making
love to one and soothing the terrors of another—what
did he say in the confidence of his inner
consciousness as he heard Mrs. Annandale’s patter,
“Indians! Indians!” He vaguely fancied there was
a relish of the situation in the face of the corporal,
but he whirled about, intending to take his hat
and go to the scene of action. Then reflection
stayed him. This would merely gratify his personal
curiosity and interest. Before he should meet the
other officers he preferred full official information of
so serious a mischance during his service as commandant
of the garrison and fort.</p>

<p>“What was saved of the corn? What was done
with it?”</p>

<p>“Lord, sir,—nothing! The fire raged like ’ell,
and was as tall as a tree, sir. And ’twas hall the
men could do, sir, to keep the armory an’ store-house
from going, too—they both caught fire. Nothing
but the tremenjous rain-burst saved the fort. The
force ’ere couldn’t handle no such fire as this ’ere
one.”</p>

<p>“I daresay,—I daresay—” Mervyn affected an
ease of manner he was far from feeling. Then fury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
for the dilemma in which he was placed overcame
him anew. “It should have been reported to me.
Who did he send here?”</p>

<p>“Meself, sir, an’ Hi ’ammered with two men. But
we was of the gyard, sir, an’ the Injuns was right
around the counterscarp an’ the horficer of the gyard
was fearful they’d rush the gate. Sure, sir, he had
the guns manned an’ fired blank ca’tridges to keep
’em at a distance.”</p>

<p>Was ever a commanding officer in so dolorous a
plight—and for no fault of his own?</p>

<p>Mervyn suddenly heard the rich stir of a paduasoy
skirt in the darkness near him, and with an effort
curbed his vexation.</p>

<p>“This is all very well, since it ends well. But,
my man, this is the duty of the officer of the guard
and the officer of the day. It doesn’t concern me.
You ought to know that. What is your mission to
me from the officer of the day?”</p>

<p>The man hesitated and stammered. He knew
that he was detailing news—the most momentous
that had befallen Fort Prince George for many a moon.
He could hardly accept the statement that it concerned
only the officer of the day. He recalled himself
hastily.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Hi was to mention Ensign Raymond’s
arrival, sir. He wishes to report to you, sir, and to
see if the leddies have any messages for Captain
Howard, sir, as ’e is about to start up the river to
rejoin ’im.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mervyn</span> had not earlier been aware of the presence
of Arabella in the dimly lighted hall during the report
of the corporal, but it was coercive now. She had
not intended concealment, and she broke out with
sudden enthusiasm. Her father’s absence counted
but a few hours, but the thought of it was as heavy
as if it had endured for a year.</p>

<p>“Lord,—to be sure we want to send messages.
Have Mr. Raymond in at once, Mr. Mervyn, and let
us hear what he has to say of papa, and how he
weathered the storm.”</p>

<p>The rich rustling of her silk dress as she fluttered
through the shadowy place, the clear, resonant note
of happiness in her voice, her gurgling, melodious
laughter, and the striking of the light on her sheeny
attire and her golden hair as she flashed into the
illuminated room beyond were as unexpected as a
supernatural vision to the corporal, standing at
gaze with his lantern at the door. Mervyn made
haste to dismiss him, hearing all the time the voices
of the ladies within raised beyond precedent.</p>

<p>“Not Indians—no Indians have come, Aunt
Claudia!” cried Arabella. The words merely added
another repetition to the monotonous chant of the
two swaying women. “No Indians at all. Ensign
Raymond has returned, and is coming in!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>She stood in the centre of the floor, resplendent
and joyous, and waved her hand at arm’s length with
a wide, free gesture to express gratulation and
safety.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale was suddenly silent, her face more
dismayed than when terror had distorted it. One
might have thought the presence of Raymond was
even less welcome than a raid of Indians. Her jaw
fell; her head-dress was awry; her eyes grew troubled
and then bright with a spark of irritation.</p>

<p>“Why does the creature have to come here? Has
George Mervyn no better sense than to receive official
reports in <i>my</i> presence?” She drew herself up to
her extreme height to express the dignity of her personality
and to repudiate the contaminating influences
of official reports. But Raymond was already at the
door.</p>

<p>A brief conference with Mervyn in the hall had
sufficed for business, for he had no official matters
to report to the acting commandant. It was merely
a form to report at all. Raymond still cherished a
proud and wounded consciousness of the false position
in which he had been placed because of an exacting
whim of his quondam friend. He could not have
put his finger on the spot, but he knew he was suffering
a counter-stroke for some blow dealt Mervyn’s vanity,
unintentionally, unperceived, he could not say how.
He had taken his punishment—the commandant’s
reprimand, a most half-hearted performance—and
the matter had passed. But Mervyn, in view of their
old intimacy, had an uneasy wonder as to the terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
on which they should meet again, and would fain it
had been otherwise than under circumstances in
which, if not obviously at fault, he was the ridiculous
sport of an unsoldierly chance. Raymond,
throughout the interview, had deported himself
with punctilious formality, saluting with the respect
due a superior officer, bearing himself with a null
inexpressiveness, phrasing what he had to say with
not a word to spare; only when he turned to the door
of the parlor, and Mervyn bade him pause, did his
impetuous identity assert itself.</p>

<p>“I hardly think,” said Mervyn, whose quick senses
had caught something of the old lady’s protest, which
reinforced a jealous folly that grudged even a glimpse
of Arabella, “that a visit is in order at present. Mrs.
Annandale is not well and the hour is late; the pettiaugre
should not be kept waiting within the reach
of marauding Indians.”</p>

<p>He even went so far as to lay a detaining hand
on the door.</p>

<p>“Under your favor, sir,” said Raymond, stiffly,
his blood boiling, his eyes on fire, “in so personal
a matter I shall not consult your pleasure. I shall
wait upon the ladies with such news as I can give
them of the expedition.”</p>

<p>He had lifted his voice, and its round, rich volume
penetrated the inner apartment. The door opened
suddenly from within and he was greeted by Arabella,
herself, in a sort of ecstasy of expectation.
The wilderness, in whose vastness her father was
submerged, seemed not so formidable when so soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
after his departure she might have word how he was
faring in its depths.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Raymond!—how good of you to come
and tell us the news—”</p>

<p>“I feared I might be intrusive,” he hesitated,
his ill-humor put to rout at the very sight of her, and
feeling a little abashed, a little wistful in having forced
his way, so to speak, into her presence.</p>

<p>“Why, no—!” she cried, her voice as fresh as a
lark’s. “I wanted to see you. I asked Mr. Mervyn
to send for you!”</p>

<p>Mervyn flushed, and as she observed it she noticed
that the red glow in Raymond’s cheeks was deeper
and richer than even their florid wont. The eyes of
both men glittered, and she had a sudden recollection
of the difficulty that had heretofore risen between
them touching the guard report,—had there been
high words in the hall, she wondered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale was endowed with many a sharp
weapon which made her enmity feared and her favor
prized, and among these were certain indescribable
subtleties of manner which she wielded with great
skill and murderous effect. The very glance of her
eye as she turned her gaze upon Raymond might have
abased many as sturdy a soul, but Arabella was
smiling upon him from the opposite side of the table,
both elbows on it and her chin on her clasped
hands.</p>

<p>“Well, you here again?” the old lady said, her keen
eyes twinkling malevolently upon him as he stood
beside a chair, his hand on its back, “we thought—we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
really labored under the impression that we said
farewell to you early this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“And you shall have that pleasure again, dear
madam, within the next few minutes,” he retorted,
with a courteous smile and a wave of the hat in his
hand.</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed—he was the very essence of
a marplot, so handsome, with such a suggestion of
reckless dash about him, yet with such a steady look
in his eye. He had, too, all the advantages of birth
and breeding, and for these she valued him even less.
They placed him where she claimed he had no right
to be, among his superiors as wealth would rate them.
She was not rich, herself, but she had a sentiment
of contumely for the indications of wear in his service
uniform, of work in his heavy service sword, of the
expectation of danger incident to his profession, and
the preparation for it evidenced in the pistols he wore
in his belt. His unpowdered hair, just drying off from
the soakings of the rain, showed its dark auburn hue.
He was all most freshly caparisoned, for the rain
had not left a dry thread on him, and he, too, was
rather conscious of the shabbiness of his second best
uniform, donned since his arrival at the fort. In comparison,
Mervyn, hovering about, was but a lace and
velvet presentment of a soldier, a travesty of the idea
expressed in fighting trim.</p>

<p>Arabella took, as she fancied, a sort of friendly
interest in Raymond—she loved that look in his
eyes, that gay, gallant, fearless glance; it reminded
her of sunlight striking on water, and she knew there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
were depths far, far beneath. There was something
so genuine, so vigorous, so hearty about his mentality;
he would not know what to do with a subterfuge.
She loved to see his rising anger; she laughed with a
flattered delight when she thought of a suggestion
of jealousy, for her sake, of Mervyn, that she had
noticed even on the first day of her arrival,—things
move swiftly on the frontier. She would like to
sit down beside him and hear him tell of his troubles,—how
he hated, and whom; how he loved, and
whom; how he had only his sword to cut his way
through the world, and his way was like this impenetrable
wilderness, too thickly grown for a knight-errant
of to-day to make place. She would care
rather to hear of his griefs than the joys of another
man. His failures were more picturesque than another
man’s successes. She would like to take out
her little house-wife, and with her crafty needle mend
that rent in his white glove as he held it in his hand.
She reached for it suddenly, and if ever Mrs. Annandale
could have bitten an unsuspicious hand it was
when her niece’s jewelled fingers began to take in and
out a tiny needle and a fine thread through the ripped
seam of the soldier’s glove.</p>

<p>“More than a few minutes,” she said, archly. “You
can’t go without this!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale had the merit of knowing when
the limit of forbearance was reached.</p>

<p>“And now, my good Mr. Raymond,” she said, with
a sour smile, “if you are quite ready, and have
peacocked about to your heart’s content, and have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
handled your sword and fiddled with your pistols
to make Arabella and me see that you have got ’em
on and are about to get used to wearing such things,
and are no play-soldier, though yesterday in the
nursery, we want to say we admire your terrible
and blood-thirsty appearance, and tremble mightily
before you, and should like to know what brought
you back, and if anything ails Captain Howard.”</p>

<p>Arabella looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing! Captain Howard is in fine health
and spirits,” Raymond hastened to stipulate.</p>

<p>“Then take time to sit down, Mr. Raymond,”
Arabella said, for Mrs. Annandale had malevolently
left him standing. “What brought you back?”</p>

<p>“The sight of the burning granary,” said Raymond,
sinking into a chair with a goodly clatter of his warlike
paraphernalia. “We had made fair headway
when we met the storm, and the wind scattered the
pettiaugres and drove us ashore. We went into an
inlet where a ravine ran down the mountain-side,
but the water rose and backed up till we took to the
rocks, and emerging upon a high pinnacle commanding
the face of the country I spied the bonfire you had
started here.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear the guns?” Mervyn asked, quietly.
He had no hope to delude the ladies with the idea
that he had ordered the protective firing. But if
Raymond had heard the circumstance of his inopportune
seclusion it might foster a doubt in his mind.</p>

<p>Arabella noted that jovial widening of the pupils
of Raymond’s eyes, an expression as hilarious as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
laugh. But he said gravely that at the distance
they had not discriminated between the discharge
of the cannon and of the thunder.</p>

<p>“Captain Howard was not very uneasy about the
Cherokees; he thought the fire was kindled by lightning,
and at all events the main part of our force
was here. But he sent me to bring certain intelligence,
and as I am to rejoin him before dawn”—he
was rising—“you will not, Mrs. Annandale,
tempt me beyond my strength.”</p>

<p>He looked down at her with so sarcastic a gleam
in his eyes that for once she was out of countenance.</p>

<p>“Hoity—toity,” she exclaimed, “we sharpen our
wits in the pettiaugres.”</p>

<p>The glove was mended. Mervyn could not judge
whether it were a mere <i>façon de parler</i>, or whether
the girl were a coquette at heart, or whether Raymond
had won upon her predilections, but he was
seriously disturbed and displeased when, with a
pretty gesture of significance, she cast it upon the
table.</p>

<p>“I fling down the glove!” she said.</p>

<p>“I lift the glove!” he responded, in his full, steady
voice.</p>

<p>And neither Mrs. Annandale nor Mervyn had quite
the courage to ask what manner of defiance this
gage signified, or whether indeed it were merely one
of those vain trifles with which young people are
wont to solace their emptiness and lack of thought.</p>

<p>Raymond was bowing over the hands of the ladies,
presently, and after the fashion of the time he carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Mrs. Annandale’s to his lips. She gave it to him
with a touch of reluctance, as if she thought he had
some cause to bite it, but he dropped the member
uninjured, and then he was gone.</p>

<p>Mervyn lingered, but the fire was low, the geniality
spent; Arabella, half lost in one of the great chairs
as she leaned far back, seemed pensive, distraite;
he, himself, could not raise his spirits to their wonted
tone; his mind was preoccupied with the unlucky
chances of the evening and the sorry figure he had
cut when his rank had placed him in command of
the fort, and when he would most desire to deserve
his prominence. Mrs. Annandale alone preserved
her uncanny, indomitable freshness, and talked on
with unabated vigor. But the evening was over;
to recur to its tender passages would need more
auspicious circumstances. He had few words for
leave-taking, and when he had gone Arabella slowly
pulled herself out of the depths of the big chair, and
said how tired she was, and how long he had stayed.
And then she yawned. Mrs. Annandale looked at
her sternly, opened her mouth for rebuke, thought
better of it, lighted her bedroom candle, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Arabella stood for some moments with her own
lighted candle in her hand. The room was otherwise
dark now, but for a dull glow of embers; the
barbaric decorations on the walls, the swan’s wings,
the aboriginal pictures, the quivers and fantastic
medley of baskets, and calabashes, and painted jugs
wavered into visibility and again disappeared as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
flame flickered in the draught. She was thinking—she
hardly knew of what—she was tired—the evening
had brought so much. She had a sense of triumph
in the capture of Mervyn, and that was an abiding
impression. She was glad to see Raymond—her
heart was warm when she thought of him. She
fancied they had quarrelled because of her, and this
made her lips curl with relish—but they might quarrel
again. She must not let Mervyn’s jealousy go
too far. She had half a mind to tell her aunt of
her victory—she, the penniless! But there would
be time enough. She took the candle in her hand
and started up the steep stairway from the hall.
It was of rude construction, and the apartment to
which it led was an empty disused place upon which
the rooms on either side opened. It was situated
in one angle of the house, and when it was built
had been intended for defensive service. Its outer
sides had a row of loop-holes at the usual height,
and its walls projected some three feet beyond the
walls below like the upper story of a block-house;
a series of loop-holes that pierced the floor close to
the outer wall gave an opportunity to its possible
defenders of shooting downward at an enemy who
should seek to enter or to fire the house below. With
all these loop-holes, admitting the air, the place was
far too open for occupation, save by soldiers, perhaps,
in stress of siege. In peace it had lapsed into simple
utility as hallway, and possessed a sort of attraction
for Arabella, so different was it from aught she had
ever seen in the old country. The commandant’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
residence, otherwise, a quadrangular building, with an
open square in the centre, wherein was a well to insure
a water supply in any event of blockade or siege,
was reminiscent to her of country granges which she
had seen on the continent, but these quaint corner
rooms above stairs, each practically a citadel, with
its loop-holes both for direct and vertical fire, seemed
to be peculiarly of the new world, full of the story
and the struggle of the frontier. Her own and her
aunt’s rooms lay to the south, her father’s to the east.
The other citadel corners and sides of the quadrangle
were appropriated to the officers of the garrison,
and, like separate houses, there was no means of
communication.</p>

<p>The great strong timbers, capable of turning a
musket-ball, the heavy low beams, all clear of cobwebs,
for these military wights were great housekeepers,
came first into view as she slowly ascended the rude
stair; then she caught a glimpse of a star shining
through a loop-hole in the wall, and she stood still
for a moment in the cavernous place, with the candle
in one hand and the other on the rough stair-rail,
while she watched its white glister, and listened to the
sullen drops falling from the eaves, and the continuous
sobbing of the unreconciled wind; then she went on
up, up, till she stood at the top and turned to glance
about, as she always did, at the place which must
have stories to tell if there were any idle enough to
listen. The next moment the candle was set a-flicker
by a gust of wind through a neighboring loop-hole.
She held up one hand to shield it. The flame suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
bowed again before the errant gust, flickered tremulously
and flared up anew, failed, and all was darkness.
Before crossing the slight distance to her
aunt’s door Arabella stood waiting till her eyes should
become more accustomed to the gloom. She knew
that the loop-holes in the floor were close to the wall,
and that so long as she kept her direction through
the middle of the apartment there was no danger
of a false step. But a certain direction is difficult to
maintain in darkness, as she realized, and she eagerly
attempted to discern the small squares of the light
outside which should apprize her of the position of
the upper row of loop-holes, just above the lower
series. She would have called out to Norah to open
the door of the lighted room, but that she dreaded
her aunt’s outcries, and reproaches, and rebukes for
the carelessness of allowing her candle to be blown
out at peril of a sprained ankle or a broken limb.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a voice in the parade; it was
near at hand and through the loop-hole at her left
she could see that two figures were standing close to
the wall below. She had no intention of listening.
She would have moved, but for her terror of the pitfalls
in the floor. Their words were few, but their
voices, though low, carried with unusual distinctness
in the dull damp air.</p>

<p>“Split me! but I’ve laughed myself sick,” Raymond
was saying. “God-a-mercy, the commandant
of a fort smirking in a lady’s parlor, while his granaries
burn and subalterns fire cannon to keep the
Indians from rushing the gates. Oh—ho! oh—ho!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
I hope I haven’t done my chest any serious damage,
but I ache fit to kill.”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Jerrold was pretty hot, to have to
shoulder all the responsibility,” said another voice
that she did not recognize. “What will the captain
say, do you suppose, when you tell him?”</p>

<p>“I shall not tell him! No—burst me if I will.
It wasn’t the damn fool’s fault. It was just so funny!
It was as if Fate had tweaked him by the nose!”</p>

<p>“He was quick enough to report <i>you</i>,” said Ensign
Lawrence. “For something not <i>your</i> fault.”</p>

<p>“Child, I never try to measure my duty by other
men’s consciences. I shall tell the captain that all
his corn is gone and his horses are inquiring about
breakfast already, and the cook has no griddle-cakes
for Mrs. Annandale—and Indian meal is the only
Indian thing she approves of. And that the guard
behaved well and stood off the Indians under the
command of a gay little ensign, who shall not be
nameless, and that the force from the barracks turned
out and dealt strenuously with the fire under the
orders of Lieutenant Jerrold, officer of the day, till
the rain took up the matter and put it out. But
unless he asks point-blank of the acting commandant
I shall say naught. Let him have all the credit he
can get—”</p>

<p>“And the young lady besides?”</p>

<p>“If she will have him.”</p>

<p>But there was a change in Raymond’s voice. He
was aware of it himself, for he broke off—“I take
it mighty kind of you, Lawrence, to let me have these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
bullets. I had enough moulded, as I thought, but the
captain—queer in an old soldier—went off without
any, and I left him all I had. But for you I couldn’t
use these pistols at all.”</p>

<p>She could see now in the pallid and uncertain moonlight
that they were dividing some small commodities
between them, and presently, the transfer complete,
she watched them trudge off toward the gates. She
stepped cautiously across the loop-holes in the floor
and looked through one of the slits high enough for
window-like usage. It gave a good range toward the
south, and she noted flickering lights at the river-bank.
Evidently Raymond was on the point of
re-embarkation. Soon the lights were extinguished,
there was more the sense of movement on the dark
water than visible craft, till suddenly a pettiaugre
glided into view in a great slant of white glister on the
shining water, with the purple mountains beyond,
and the massive wooded foothills on either side,
with the tremulous stars, and the skurrying clouds, and
the fugitive moon above. And on—and on—and
on in this white glister, as in some enchanted progress,
the lonely boat glided till it rounded the point,
and was lost to view.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was dawn when Raymond sighted Little Tamotlee,
and the early sunshine, of an exquisite crystalline
purity, was over all the world—misty mountain,
shimmering river, the infinite stretches of the leafless
wilderness—as the young officer’s pettiaugre was
pulling into the bank, where Captain Howard’s boats
were already beached. The Indian town on the shore,
an oasis of habitation in the midst of the unpeopled
forest, was all astir. Columns of smoke were rising
alike from the conical-roofed dwellings of the characteristic
Indian architecture and those more modern
structures which the Cherokees also affected, and
which resembled the log cabins of the European settlers
in the provinces to the eastward. The population
seemed all afoot, as if some event of moment impended.
Knots of braves pressed hither and thither,
with feather-crested heads and painted faces, arrayed
in buck-skin or fur shirts and leggings with floating
fringes, and many tawdry gauds of decorated quivers
and bows, carried for ornament only, long ago discarded
as a weapon in favor of the British “Brown
Bess,” and powder and lead. The chiefs, the cheerataghe
or priests, the political head-men, and the
warriors of special note were all easily distinguishable
to Raymond, as he stood in the bow of the boat, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
reason of their splendor of attire, their feather-braided
iridescent mantles, or their war bonnets of vertically
placed swan’s quills, standing fifteen inches high,
above the forehead. On the summit of the tall
mound, where the great dome-like rotunda or town-house
was perched,—its contour conserved by a
thick plaster of the tenacious red clay of the region
laid on smoothly, inside and out,—a white flag was
flying. Presently a wide sonorous voice sounded
thence. The Cherokee town-crier was uttering the
“News Hollow.” It was strictly an official demonstration,
for the arrival of Captain Howard and his
escort in the night, now quartered in the “Stranger house,”
was an event that had fallen under the personal
observation of all the denizens of Tamotlee.
Nevertheless, every man paused where he stood, as
if the sound of that great voice possessed gifts of
enchantment, and he were bound to the spot.</p>

<p>Raymond, who had caught up some familiarity
with the language, was too distant as he stood in
the gliding boat, now swiftly approaching the shore,
to discriminate the words, but as the proclamation
ceased he perceived that all were pressing toward the
“beloved square” of the town, a rectangular space,
level, and covered with fine white sand, beaten, and
trampled, and worn to the hardness and consistency
of stone. There was a commodious piazza-like building
of logs and bark, having the whole front open,
situated at each side of the square, appropriated to
the different branches, so to speak, of the primitive
government, and these began to fill quickly with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
officials of each department,—the ancient councillors
on the east, the cheerataghe on the west, the warriors
on the north, clanging with martial accoutrement,
and on the south the functionaries that the European
traders, called “The Second Men,” these being, as it
were, “the city fathers,” having control of all municipal
affairs,—the building of houses, the planting and
garnering of the public crops, the succor of the poor,
the conduct of negotiations with other towns, the
care of the entertainment of strangers. It was in
their charge that Raymond presently perceived, with
that amusement which the methods of the savages
always excited in European breasts, Captain Howard
and his escort. Very funny, in truth, they looked,
their fresh British faces adjusted to a sedulous gravity
and inexpressiveness and their manner stiffened to
conform to Indian etiquette, and manifest neither
curiosity nor amusement. This was difficult for one
of the young soldiers, a raw Irish boy, whose teeth
now and again gleamed inadvertently, giving the
effect of being swallowed, so suddenly did his lips snap
together as his orders recurred to his mind. His
head seemed set on a pivot when first he took his seat
with the others on the benches in the booth-like place,
but a sudden stroke upon the cranium from a drum-stick
in the seemingly awkward handling of Robin
Dorn, sitting beside him and moving the instrument
as if for added safety, was a sufficient admonition to
foster a creditable degree of discretion. Captain
Howard’s typically English face, florid, smooth,
steadfast-eyed, evidencing a dignity and self-respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
that coerced a responsive respect, was indeed curiously
out of place seen above the bar of the booth-like piazza,
where he sat on the lower settee, his men ranged in
tiers behind him. When Raymond, who was met at
the water’s edge by a messenger for the purpose, was
conducted to a place by Captain Howard, he rather
wondered that they had not been given seats beside
Rolloweh, the prince of the town, in the western
cabin, for it was the habit of the Indians to pay almost
royal honors to their guests of official station. He
took the place assigned him in silence, and he observed
that the occasion was indeed one of special importance,
for Captain Howard said not a word, made not an
inquiry as to his mission, save by a lifted eyebrow.
Raymond answered by a debonair smile, intimating
that all was well. Then both turned their eyes to
the “beloved square,” and this moment the Reverend
Mr. Morton was led out in charge of two Indians and
stationed before the great white seat of the “holy
cabin.” Captain Howard flushed deeply and darkly
red, but made no other sign, and such proceedings
began as Rolloweh had elected should take place.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton was old, and lank, and pallid, and
dreary. No affinity had he with the portly and well-liking
type of his profession of his day. Such manna
as gave them a repletion of self-satisfaction had been
denied him. He had an infinite capacity for hardship,
an absolute disdain of danger. Luxury affected his
ascetic predilections like sin. He desired but a meditative
crust to crunch while he argued the tenets of
his religion and refuted the contradictions of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
catechumen. He was as instant in and out of season
as if he were in pursuit of some worldly preferment—one
can say no more. He did not need encouragement,
and he was so constituted that he could recognize
no failure. He had no vain-glory in his courage—to
him it was the most natural thing in the world
to risk his life to save Rolloweh’s soul. He knew it
was rank heresy to think it, but he was willing to
trust the salvation of Captain Howard and the garrison
of Fort Prince George to their own unassisted efforts,
and such mercy as the Lord might see fit to grant
their indifference, their ignorance, their folly, and
their perversity. But Rolloweh’s soul had had no
chances, and he was bound personally to look after
it. He even hoped for the conversion of those great
chiefs of the upper towns—Yachtino of Chilhowee,
Cunigacatgoah of Choté, Moy Toy of Tellico Great,
and Quorinnah of Tennessee Town. He was worldly
wise in his day and generation, too. He had fastened
with the unerring instinct of the born missionary on
the propitious moment. Not while prosperity shone
upon them, not while their savage religion met every
apparent need, not while facile chance answered
their ignorant prayer, was the conversion of a people
practicable. But the Cherokees were conquered,
abased, decimated, the tribe scattered, their towns in
ruins, the bones held sacred of their dead unburied,
their ancient cherished religion fallen in esteem to a
meaningless system of inoperative rites and flimsy
delusions. Now was the time to reveal the truth, to
voice “the good tidings of great joy.” Hence he had
said, “Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>And the common people had been listening to him
gladly. Thus the chiefs feared they would never
seek to made head against their national enemies
under their national rulers. Simple as he stood there
in his thread-bare black clothes and his darned hose,—he
was wondrously expert with a meditative needle,—he
had the political future of a people and the
annihilation of a false and barbarous worship in his
grasp. Therefore said the Cherokee rulers to Captain
Howard—“Your beloved man must remove
himself.”</p>

<p>It was an old story to the soldier. He had written
to the missionary and remonstrated, for peace was
precious. In reply he had in effect been admonished
to render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s and
unto God the things that are God’s. A meek address
was not among the merits of the Reverend Mr. Morton.
The obvious interpretation of this saying seemed
to the commandant a recommendation to go about
his business. He desisted from advice for a time.
He had known a certain luke-warmness in religious
matters to ensue upon a surcharge of zeal, and he had
waited with patience for the refined and delicately
nurtured old man to tire of the hardships of life in
that devastated country among the burned towns
and the angry, sullen people, and the uncouth savage
association. But he had continued to preach, and
the tribesmen had continued in hordes to listen,
expecting always to discover the secret of the superiority
of the British in the arts of war and manufacture,—the
reason of their own deplorable desolation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
destruction. They could not separate the ideas of
spiritual acceptability and worldly prosperity. The
Briton revered his religion, they argued, and therefore
he knew how to make gun-powder, and to conquer
the bravest of the brave, and to amass much moneys
of silver and gold,—for in their enlightenment the
roanoke and the wampum were a wofully depreciated
currency,—perhaps it was the religion of the British
people which made them so strong. Thus the Cherokees
lent a willing ear. As they began to discriminate
and memorize, certain familiarities in the matters
offered for their contemplation were dimly recognized.
The archaic figment or fact—whichever it may
be—that the ancient Scriptures had once been theirs,
and through negligence lost, and through degeneration
forgotten, reasserted its hold. The points of similarity
in their traditions to the narrations of the old Bible
were suggested to Mr. Morton, who accepted them
with joy, becoming one of the early converts to the
theory of the Hebraic origin of the tribes of American
Indians. It was a happy time for the scholarly old
man—to find analogies in their barbarous rites with
ancient Semitic customs; to reform from the distortions
of oral teachings a divine oracle of precious
significance; to show in the old stories how the prophecy
fore-shadowed the event, how the semblance
merged into the substance in the coming of the Christ.
In this way he approached their conversion to Christianity
from the vantage ground of previous knowledge,
however distorted and inadequate, and commingled
with profane and barbaric follies. He was convinced—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
convinced many—that they were of an inherited
religion, into which he had been adopted, that
they were descendants of the lost tribes of Israel,
that the Scriptures they had had were a part of the
Book he revered, and that he would indoctrinate
them into the remainder. Perhaps Mr. Morton
doubted the account of the teachings of the Roman
Catholic captive, Cabeza de Vaca, among the Floridian
Indians early in the sixteenth century, or perhaps
he disbelieved that any remnants of such precepts had
drifted so far to this secluded and inimical tribe, always
at war as it was with its southern neighbors and totally
without communication with them.</p>

<p>Though this persuasion took hold on the masses
it encountered great disfavor among the chiefs, more
especially when the valorous and fearless old man
thundered rebukes upon their pagan follies and
observances, their superstitions, their methods of appeasing
the “Great White Fire.” He knew no moderation
in rebuke; intolerance is the good man’s sin.
He was especially severe in his denunciation of the
pretended powers of necromancy, above all of the
supernatural endowment of a certain amulet which
they possessed and which by the earlier travellers
among them is termed their “Conjuring-Stone.”</p>

<p>This was said to be a great red crystal. According
to Adair, the historian, it was a gigantic carbuncle;
others have called it a garnet—these gems are still
found in the Great Smoky Mountains; more probably
it was a red tourmaline of special depth and
richness of color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>Mr. Morton had never seen the stone, but Cunigacatgoah
of Choté had told him triumphantly that he
could never captivate his soul, for he held the precious
amulet in his hand whenever the missionary
preached, and it dulled the speech, so that he heard
nothing. As the aged Cunigacatgoah had been deaf
these several years, this miracle had involved little
strain on the powers of the stone. These days were
close upon the times of witchcraft, of the belief in
special obsessions, of all manner of magic. This
stubborn and persistent paganism roused the utmost
rancor and ingenuity of the Reverend Mr. Morton,
and at last he made a solemn statement in the council-house
of Choté, in the presence of many witnesses,
that if they would show him one miracle wrought by
the stone, if they could bring positive testimony of
one evil averted by the amulet, he would renounce his
religion and his nation, he would become an adopted
Cherokee and a pagan; he would poll his hair, and
dance in three circles, and sacrifice to the “Ancient
White Fire” and the little Thunder men.</p>

<p>In the sullen silence that had ensued upon this
declaration he had demanded why had the amulet not
stayed the march of the British commander, Colonel
Grant, through the Cherokee country? Why had it
not checked the slaughters and the burnings? Why
had it not saved to the Cherokees the vast extent of
country ceded for a punitive measure in the pacification
and forced treaties of peace? Where was the
luck it had brought? Defend all good people from
such a possession!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>The old missionary owed his life less to any fear
that should he disappear the British government might
bethink itself of such a subject as a superannuated
and pious old scare-crow in the barren field of the
Cherokee country than to the hold he had taken
on the predilections of the people. There was
scant use in burning him—many among themselves
would resent his fate. He, himself, would rejoice in
martyrdom, and their utmost deviltries would add to
his crown.</p>

<p>The savage leaders had a certain natural sagacity.
Wiser than they of eld they cried not upon Baal.
They would not accept the challenge of the man of
God. They would not produce the amulet at his
bidding, lest it be discredited—they said the touch,
the evil eye of a stranger were a profanation. Yet
they feared that the conversion of the people to
Christianity was national annihilation. And they
clung to their superstitions, their polytheistic venerations,
their ancient necromancies, their pagan observances;
to them all other gods were strange gods.
They realized the hold which the new faith was taking
on the tribesmen. Therefore they had told Mr.
Morton that he had long plagued them with many
words and they desired him to leave the country.
When he refused in terms they despatched a delegation
to refer the matter to Captain Howard at Fort
Prince George, with a most insistent demand that he
should return with it and meet them at Little
Tamotlee, a village at no difficult distance from
the fort itself, and easily accessible by boat, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
reason of the confluence of the Keowee and Tugaloo
rivers.</p>

<p>This was one of the smaller towns of the Ayrate
district, sending only sixty gun-men to the wars and
with a population of women and children in proportion.
The inhabitants could by no means muster
such an assemblage as had now gathered. Visitors
whom Raymond, familiar with the people, recognized
as hailing from the towns of the Ottare region had
crowded in, making the day in some sort a representative
occasion. They had arranged themselves
around the “beloved square,” some standing, some
seated, others kneeling on one knee, and the proceedings
had well begun before Captain Howard
realized what manner of part he was expected to sustain.
In noting the number of chiefs ranged in state
in the “holy cabin” on the “great white seat,” Raymond
thought that the lack of space might explain
the fact that Captain Howard was not offered a
place commensurate with his rank and importance
on the frontier. After a few moments, however, he
understood that this subsidiary position better accorded
with the rôle assigned to the commandant.</p>

<p>The row of chiefs glittered in the brilliant sunlight,
in their rich fur shirts, their feather-woven mantles,
their plumed crests, their gayly painted faces, their
silver bracelets worn above the elbow, their silver
head-bands and earrings, their many glancing necklaces
of roanoke,—all, however, devoid of any weapon
worn in sight. The wind was gentle, yet fresh; the
hour was still early,—the Reverend Mr. Morton’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
shadow was even longer and lanker than his tall, bony
anatomy might seem to warrant. His attendants, or
guards, had taken off his shovel hat and clerical wig,
and his head was bare, save for its wandering wisps
of gray hair, blowing about his face and neck,—and
whenever Captain Howard glanced toward him he
turned as red as his scarlet coat, his eyes fell, he
cleared his throat uneasily. He had long been
habituated by the exigencies of his military service
to the exercise of self-control, and he had need now
of all the restraints of his training.</p>

<p>The preacher opened the session, so to speak, by
demanding in a very loud voice, with every assurance
of manner and in fluent Cherokee, why he was
arraigned thus amongst his friends.</p>

<p>Rolloweh, a man of a fierce, hatchet-shaped face,
rendered sinister of expression by the loss of one eye,
rose and imperatively bade him be silent.</p>

<p>“I will not hold my peace,” declared the venerable
missionary. “I will know why I am brought here, and
why these,”—he waved his hand—“have assembled.”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Rolloweh, the Raven, craftily,
“you have too many words. You weary our ears
waking, and in our dreams you still talk on. We have
loved you—have we not listened to you? You are
our friend, and you have dwelt in our hearts. We
have seen you shed tears for our sorrows. You
have lent ears to our plaints and you have eaten our
salt. You have given of your goods to the needy and
have even wrought with your hands in building again
the burned houses. You have paid with English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
money for your keep and have been a charge to no
man.”</p>

<p>He looked with a steady, observant eye to the right
and the left of the rows of eager listening faces.
They could but note that he had religiously given the
old man his due, for the good missionary was much
beloved of the people.</p>

<p>“But your talk is not a straight talk. You have
the crooked tongue. You tell lies to mislead the
Cherokee people—who are a free people—and to
make them slaves to the British. You tell them
that these lies are religion—that they are the religion
of the British people.”</p>

<p>There was absolute silence as his impassioned tones,
voicing the musical, liquid Cherokee words, rolled out
on the still morning air.</p>

<p>“You say that the tongue is a fire—it kindles
about you, for these lies that you have spoken. You
are our friend, but you stretch our hearts to bursting.
We have besought you to leave the country and mislead
our youth no more. You have been stubborn.
You say—‘Woe!’ and you will preach! We have
summoned this Capteny Howard, a beloved man of
the English king, to question between you and show
these men from the towns that what you teach our
youth is not the English religion, but a charm to bind
the Cherokee.”</p>

<p>Through the interpreter these words were perfectly
intelligible to Captain Howard, and for one moment
it seemed as if this officer—a stalwart specimen of
middle-aged vigor—might faint; then, with a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
revulsion of color, as if he might go off in an apoplexy.
To be so entrapped! To be caught in the toils of a
public religious controversy dismayed him more than
an ambush of warriors. But the old missionary’s
life might depend upon his answers. They must
confirm the “straightness” of Mr. Morton’s talk. He
must prove that the teaching of the parson to the
Cherokee nation was not a snare for Cherokee liberties,
but the familiar religion of the British people,
known and practised by all.</p>

<p>It was not to be presumed that with these postulants
Mr. Morton had delved very deeply into sacerdotal
mysteries and fine and abstruse doctrines of
theology, but Captain Howard was so obviously relieved
when his interpreter, standing very straight
and stiff outside his booth,—a man whom he had
employed as a scout,—repeated the words flung at
him by the interpreter of Rolloweh, who stood very
straight and stiff outside the “holy cabin,” that Raymond,
despite his surprise, and agitation, and anxiety
could have laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a man called Noah?”</p>

<p>“Yes—oh, yes, indeed,” said Captain Howard, so
plumply affirmative and familiar that they might have
expected to hear him add that he had served with
Noah in the Hastenbeck campaign.</p>

<p>All the eyes of the Cherokees around the vacant
square were fixed first upon the questioner, Rolloweh,
and then upon Captain Howard, in the incongruous
rôle of catechumen. The space was not so large as
in the “beloved squares” of towns of greater population,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
comprising perhaps not more than one acre.
Every word could be heard—every facial change
discriminated. Mr. Morton stood as if half amused,
one thumb thrust in his fob, his grizzled eye-brows
elevated, his thin wisps of hair tossed about his
bare poll, a smile on his face, listening with an indulgent
meditative air to the inquiries of Rolloweh
propounded in Cherokee, which, of course, he understood,
and the sturdy cautious response of the British
commandant. Captain Howard had not thought so
much about Biblical matters since he sat and swung
his feet in his callow days to be catechised by the
nursery governess.</p>

<p>“Did he have a house that could float?” demanded
the interrogator.</p>

<p>“Oh, he did,—he did indeed,” declared Captain
Howard, freely.</p>

<p>There was a certain satisfaction perceptible on the
face of Rolloweh, despite the enigmatical cast given
it by the loss of his eye. The other head-men, too,
assisting at this unique literary exercise, showed an
animation, a gleam of triumph, at every confirmation
of the ancient Biblical stories found by the early
missionaries to be curiously, mysteriously familiar
to all the pagan Cherokees, distorted in detail sometimes,
and sometimes in pristine proportions. When
a sudden blight fell upon the smooth progress of this
comparative theology and the question awoke from
Captain Howard no responsive assurance of knowledge,
Raymond was more sensibly impressed by the gloom,
the disappointment that settled upon the faces of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
head-men on the “great white seat.” He could not
understand it. The Indians were very subtle—or
did they really desire the verification of what they
had been taught by the missionary.</p>

<p>The “beloved square” was absolutely silent. The
shadow of a white cloud high in the blue zenith crossed
the smooth sanded space; they could hear the Tugaloo
River fretting on the rocks a mile down-stream.
The bare branches of the encompassing forests, with
no sign that the spring of the year pulsed in their
fibres, that the sap was rising, clashed lightly together
in a vagrant gust and fell still again.</p>

<p>Captain Howard knitted a puzzled brow, and his
men, ranged in tiers of seats back of him, who had
been startled and amazed beyond expression by the
unexpected developments, gazed down upon him
with a ludicrous anxiety lest he fail to acquit himself
smartly and do himself and the command credit,
and with an <i>esprit de corps</i> wholly at variance with
the subject-matter of the examination.</p>

<p>“Why, no,” the officer said at last, “I don’t think
I ever before heard of the dogs.”</p>

<p>He cast a furtive glance of deprecation at the missionary,
who still stood, listening unmoved and immovable,
fixing his eyes with a look of whimsical
self-communing on the ground as if waiting, steeling
himself in patience till this folly should wear itself
out of its own fatuity.</p>

<p>“Never heard of the Dogs of Hell?” Rolloweh at
last asked with a tone insistently calculated to jog
the refractory memory. Raymond marked with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
renewal of surprise his eagerness that the officer should
retract. Captain Howard frowned with impatience.
What an ordeal was this! That the life of a blatant
and persistent preacher—yet an old and a saintly
man—should depend upon the accuracy of his
recollection of Scriptural details to which he had not
given more than a passing thought for thirty years.
What strange unimagined whim could be actuating
the Indians? He might have prevaricated had he but
a serviceable phrase to fill the breach. He could not
foresee the result, and he dubiously adhered to the
truth.</p>

<p>“I have heard of Cerberus, the three-headed classical
dog, you know, Mr. Morton. But I don’t remember
any religious dog at all.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a time. Then Rolloweh began
to speak again, and the voice of Captain Howard’s
interpreter quavered as he proceeded to instruct his
sturdy commander.</p>

<p>“You surely know that as you go to hell you reach
a deep gulf full of fire. A pole is stretched across it,
with a dog at each end. The beloved man of the king
of England must know that pole right well?”</p>

<p>Captain Howard doggedly shook his head.</p>

<p>“Never heard of the pole.”</p>

<p>Rolloweh persisted, and the interpreter quavered
after.</p>

<p>“The wicked—the great Capteny, precious to the
hearts of the Cherokees, cannot be considered of the
number—the wicked are chased by one of the dogs
on to this pole, and while crossing the fiery gulf the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
dog at the other end shakes the pole and they fall off
into Hell. Now surely the great Capteny remembers
the Dogs of Hell?”</p>

<p>Surely Captain Howard’s face seemed incapable of
such a look of supplication as he sent toward Mr.
Morton, who was gazing smilingly straight at him, as
if the whole session were an invented diversion for
the day. The clergyman gave no intimation as to
how to meet the situation, and Captain Howard reiterated
sturdily—“Never heard of any religious
dogs,” and lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>He was beginning to grow extremely disquieted, to
doubt his wisdom in coming in response to their summons,
and sooth to say if he had dreamed of the intention
animating it he would have considered twice
ere he consented. He had thought only of soothing
their rancors and smoking the “friend pipe.” The
freakish fierce temper of the Cherokees could not be
trusted, and they felt aggrieved in a certain sort
that they were not left to such solace as they might
find in their polytheism, or Great Spirit worship, or
the necromancy of their Conjuring-Stone, but must
needs be converted or regenerated on the plan of
salvation which the missionary set forth with such
ruthless logic. It was evident that they had found
it necessary to discredit the preacher, and with this
view the assemblage had been gathered as witnesses.
Albeit Captain Howard did not understand its trend,
he saw the investigation was going amiss,—Mr. Morton’s
life would prove the forfeit. He trembled, too,
for the lives of his escort—they were but a handful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
among some hundreds of vigorous braves. His were
troops flushed with recent victories, and if he had
found it hard to witness unmoved the venerable
missionary before such a tribunal, how must the scene
strike the young, ardent, impulsive soldiers? Some
thoughtless action, some inconsiderate word or look,
and the lives of all would not be worth a moment’s
purchase.</p>

<p>The investigation fared little better when it quitted
the infernal regions. Captain Howard, troubled,
flushed, with an unsteady eye and an uncertain
manner, watched disconsolately by his whole escort,
knew nothing about a multiplicity of heavens.</p>

<p>He had heard the phrase “seven heavens” in ordinary
conversation, but he had never been taught it
was Scriptural. He was prompted, urged, goaded to
a modification of this statement. Did he not know
that the first heaven was little higher than the tops
of the Great Smoky Mountains, but this proved too
warm—therefore God created a second heaven, and
then others until the ideal temperature was reached in
the seventh heaven, where the Great Spirit dwelt,
which was the reason that in prayer all should raise
the hands seven times before speaking? No, the
Capteny knew none of these things. And Rolloweh’s
eye, resting on him with an access of rancor, suggested
a doubt of the officer’s ignorance of such simple and
obvious lore. He was found deficient, too, in any
knowledge of a statement made by Rolloweh that
one of the most significant warnings given rebellious
man before the Deluge was the unprecedented fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
that several infants were born with whole sets of
teeth.</p>

<p>This ignorance vanished in the meeting with
Moses. The officer knew him well and was even
able to recognize him under the name of Wasi. In the
wilderness Captain Howard, in the phrase of to-day,
was “all there.” Never did pilgrims so gayly fare
through benighted wastes as he and Rolloweh, while
they traced all the consecutive steps toward the Promised
Land and lived anew the familiar incidents of the
wanderings. True, he gave a lamentably uncertain
sound as to the tint of the standards, and did not believe
that the Holy Scriptures stated that one was
white and one was red, but Rolloweh so slurred this
matter that it was obvious to all observers that the
two men were practically of one mind and one source
of information thus far.</p>

<p>The escort had taken heart of grace at perceiving
their commander’s feet once more on solid ground—so
to speak—in fact, they waxed so insolently
confident as to grow drearily tired and absent-minded,
as if at prolonged Sunday prayers in garrison or a
lengthy sermon, but the attention of the Indians
never flagged. Suddenly the crisis came when Rolloweh
demanded:—</p>

<p>“The Capteny is a Christian?”</p>

<p>Captain Howard stanchly declared that he was.</p>

<p>“If a man should strike you on one cheek, Capteny,
would you turn the other?”</p>

<p>The blow had fallen—the bomb had burst. Yet
Captain Howard, somewhat blown, perhaps from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
brisk jaunt through the wilderness, did not realize
its full significance. He sat silent for a moment,
blankly staring.</p>

<p>There was a stir in the great white seat of the “holy
cabin,” sinister, inimical. An answer must be forthcoming.
Captain Howard hesitated, a vicarious
fear in his eyes—a fear for the missionary who
suddenly called out—“Oh, man of blood! Would
you forswear yourself?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, glad to rely on his sturdy veracity;
“I would not turn the other cheek.”</p>

<p>“And this,” cried Rolloweh, addressing the assemblage
with sudden passion, “the forked tongue
of this old serpent of the provinces”—he waved his
hand at arm’s length toward the missionary, “teaches
is religion for the Cherokee. Not for the British!
The religion that has been the same road till now
branches with a white, smooth path for the British,
and a bloody, rocky, dark path for the Cherokee.”</p>

<p>A visible sensation swayed the crowd. The Indians
exchanged glances of doubt, surprise, excitement,
or triumph as the individual sentiment of
congratulation or disappointment or indignation predominated.
The soldiers looked at one another
in dismay. Captain Howard, fairly ambushed, hardly
knew which way to turn. Only the missionary stood
unmoved, still gazing smilingly, indulgently, at the
officer who had begun to fear that he had unwittingly
compassed the old man’s ruin.</p>

<p>“Did the Capteny ever see any other Christian
Briton who was struck and who turned the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
cheek?”—Rolloweh demanded, pushing his advantage.
Even the interpreter’s voice faltered as he
put the query into English.</p>

<p>Captain Howard was minded to vouchsafe no
reply. He had already been entrapped, it was true,
through too anxious a desire to placate the savages,
to conserve the peace of the frontier, and save the
life of the old missionary. He might have done
harm, rather than good, so impossible was it to forecast
the event under circumstances so unprecedented.
Then he resolutely swallowed his pride. The safety
of his men was his primal consideration.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, albeit a trifle sullenly, “I never
saw a Christian struck who turned the other cheek.”</p>

<p>Rolloweh rose, with a fierce smile, bending to
the crowd, waving both arms with the palms outward.</p>

<p>“If a man took your cloak, O Christian Capteny,
would you give him your coat also?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“No,” snarled the Christian captain, “I’d give
him a beating.”</p>

<p>There was a guttural sarcastic laugh around the
square, ceasing as Rolloweh resumed:</p>

<p>“But this is the religion for the Cherokees—that
they may be meek and broken, and after the land
fling the weapon, and wear the yoke and drag the
chain. Men and brothers, the spirits of the dead will
rise against you if you suffer this. It is not agreeable
to the old beloved rites that we tolerate this serpent
of the forked tongue to scoff at our ancient worship
and bring in a new religion, manufactured for the free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
and independent Cherokee, which means British
rule.”</p>

<p>There is something strangely daunting in the half-suppressed
tumult of an angry crowd. It was not
merely that an imprecation was heard here and the
sibilance of whispered conspiracy there, or that restless
gestures betokened a rising menace,—it was that a
total change had come upon the aspect of the assemblage,
as unmistakable as if a storm-cloud had
blighted the day. The people were convinced. The
work of the missionary was annihilated in this masterstroke
of craft. To him it was only a reason for a
renewal of his labors. When Captain Howard, tearing
a leaf from his note-book, wrote a few words
upon it and sent it into the “beloved square” by
the interpreter, the clergyman merely glanced at it
with a shaking head, and tossed it aside, saying with
a smile, “No—my place is here. Woe is unto me if
I preach not the gospel!”</p>

<p>Rolloweh had watched the communication with
jealous disfavor, but as the familiar words resounded
on the air his eye glittered, his long, cruel, flat lips
were sternly compressed; he glanced over to the booth
where the English officer so incongruously was stationed,
and enunciated the fatal words,—“Your
beloved man will be removed.”</p>

<p>The attentive crowd caught the phrase, and a
keen, savage cry of triumph suddenly broke forth,
unlike anything ever voiced by civilized man—an
utterance blended of the shrill exultation of a beast
of prey, and the guttural human halloo, indescribable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
nerve-thrilling, never to be forgotten, once heard.
The transformation was complete. They were no
more men—not even savages; they had entered
upon that peculiar phase of their being which seems
to those of different standards absolutely demoniac
and demented. There was no right reason in some
of the faces gazing at the impassive, unmoved old
man in the centre of the square. They were waiting
only the word for an act from which the imagination
shrinks appalled. Captain Howard’s fears were
intensified for his stalwart young soldiers, despite the
terrors of the retributive power of England which the
recent Cherokee war against the British government
had served to induce in the tribe. As the swaying of
the crowd and the gaudily decorated figures of the
head-men in the “holy white cabin” betokened the
breaking-up of the assemblage, he ordered a young
sergeant to have the men fall in quietly and keep them
together. Captain Howard’s attention was suddenly
bespoken by the appearance of two or three chiefs
who claimed a personal acquaintance, and who were
approaching across the square to meet him. They
were wreathing their harsh countenances into sardonic
smiles, but they called out: “How! How!”
very pleasantly by way of salutation.</p>

<p>Constrained to await their greeting, he bethought
himself that perhaps some new influence, a fresh
urgency, might avail with the stubborn old missionary.</p>

<p>“Raymond,” he said in a low voice to the ensign,
“do you go to the Reverend Mr. Morton and use your
best endeavors to persuade him to embark with us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
If he remains here after our departure I fear me much
these damn scoundrels will burn him alive.”</p>

<p>“I think I can persuade him, sir,” said the capable
and confident ensign.</p>

<p>Captain Howard looked hard at the dashing and
debonair young officer, erect, stalwart, alert, clear-eyed,
as he lifted his hand to the brim of his cocked
hat and turned away, jostled considerably in his
movements, and perhaps intentionally, by a dozen
or more contumacious looking tribesmen, who were
awkwardly crowding about the booth assigned to
the soldiers.</p>

<p>“Take three men with you, Ensign,” added Captain
Howard. He had a positive fear that alone the subaltern
might be attacked in the press, throttled, whisked
away, tortured on the sly, and mysteriously disappearing,
be lost to the service forever. “A trio of
wide red Irish mouths,” he thought, “could not
easily be silenced.”</p>

<p>And with this preparation for the graces of social
intercourse he turned to greet the three chiefs who
now came up with acclamations of pleasure, desirous
of showing their companions the degree of consideration
they enjoyed on the part of the commander
of his Majesty’s fort.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> a man whose life is regulated on a basis of a
difference in rank, a part of whose training is to conserve
the respect due his military station and his social
supremacy, who is habituated to stiff formalities of
address, both in phrase and bearing, the familiarities
of an inferior have a grossness which a custom of
lenient condescension, or kindly indulgence, or careless
indifference does not as readily perceive. But no
man, however little fastidious, would have relished
the peculiar impediments to Raymond’s progress
across the limited space of the “beloved square” to
the spot where he thought—he could now no longer
see for the press—the old missionary was standing.
Indeed, Raymond might have better exerted tolerance
had he not perceived that the demonstration was
actuated by a rancorous spirit. The contact with the
blanketed shoulders of the braves intentionally
thrust against him to impede his progress; a peering,
painted face stuck almost against his own, the survey
followed by a wild cackle of derision; a feathered
crest of a man, not so tall as he, jerked into his eyes,
were incidents calculated to try the self-control of an
ardent, impetuous young soldier to the extremest
tension. He set his teeth and held hard to his composure,
though his cheek flushed and his eye glittered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Naught that was personal should jeopardize the success
of the forlorn hope of his appeal to the fears of
the old missionary. The sturdy soldiers at his heels
marked his demeanor and emulated his self-restraint.
Presently, he almost ran against the old man, still
bare-headed, still between his guards, replying in
Cherokee to the jeers or reproaches of his recent
converts as they gathered about him, upbraiding for
double-dealing, and threatening as if with the just
wrath of the deceived. He had a wistful, pained look
as he sought to justify himself, to explain the misunderstanding,
and it cut Raymond to the heart. He
was of the temperament which throws itself with
ardor into the joys and griefs of others—especially
he deprecated infinitely the sight of sorrow in the
aged. Let the young wrestle with the woes of life—not
when strength, and hope, and illusion are all
gone! He accosted the old man in a cheery voice,
speaking in English, that the crowd might catch no
chance word of offence.</p>

<p>“Captain Howard presents his compliments, Reverend
sir, and wishes me to say that we have a place
in our boat, which is at your service, and we shall
feel much honored if you will occupy it,” he said.</p>

<p>The old man, turning from the revilings and the
insults heaped upon him by the savage rabble, must
have felt an attraction toward the young, spirited
face, and have softened to the sympathy in the ensign’s
eyes, the respect that vibrated in every inflection
of his voice.</p>

<p>“I thank you, my young friend,” he said in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
kindly tone, “but my station is here. I cannot desert
my post. I am a soldier of the Cross.”</p>

<p>“Under your favor, Reverend sir, we are taught
that we have no right to throw away our lives in
desperate emprises, to the loss and detriment of the
British service. And it seems to me that the rule
ought to hold in the service of the Cross that sorely
needs good soldiers.”</p>

<p>The argument struck home, and the old missionary
made haste to justify his position.</p>

<p>“There is not more danger than usual,” he declared,
“I have often heard such threats. I have weathered
many such storms. My place is here. I must recall
these troubled and wandering sheep that have believed
in the truth and trusted in me, and whose
faith has this day been so rudely jostled.”</p>

<p>“Troubled and wandering—wolves!” Raymond
could not help exclaiming, as he noted the furious
faces, the menacing gestures of a group here and
there colloguing apart, their feathered heads almost
touching each other, their drapery of coarse blankets
intermingled as they stood together, an absorbed
brow lifted now and again to glance at the subject of
their conference. The dispensation that the sun
shall shine alike upon the just and the unjust seemed
more an insensate process of nature than a divine
ordinance at that moment as he looked about mechanically
in the pause, noting the pellucid brilliance of
the noontide splendor that lay over all the wrangling
crowd of braves, the huddled huts of the town, the
vast stretches of leafless woods that had yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
aspect of winter, the blurred violet tones of the hills
hard by, the far-reaching of the myriads of azure
ranges, the differing blue of the sky as it bent to meet
the horizon. So unwontedly still had been the town
during the morning that a drift of white swans lay
asleep in the river, close to the moorings of Raymond’s
pettiaugre. Now, warned by the tumult on shore,
they had lifted their heads and were beginning to
glide imperceptibly along. A deer, approaching the
town on the hither side, had taken sudden affright,
and, plunging into the water, was swimming the river
so near at hand that its head presented a fair target
to the short-range rifles of the day and even for an
arrow. No marksman sought the opportunity. The
minds of the braves were all intent, undivided. The
dogs of the town caught the scent and sight, and
half a dozen hounds raced to the water-side, lustily
yelping excitement. But there was no human cry
of encouragement, no command to hie them on, and
though one plunged in and swam twenty yards in
the wake of the fleeing animal, he lost heart in thus
proceeding on his own initiative, and turning about,
came splashing in to the bank, all unnoticed. Significant
incidents these trifles seemed to Raymond,
showing an absorption that betokened no gentle
fate to the old missionary. He marvelled that the
old man could be so mad. He determined on a
renewed effort.</p>

<p>“You could return at a more propitious time,
dear sir. And permit me to express my wonder,
Mr. Morton,” he said, with gentle reproach, “that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
though you do not entertain fears for yourself, you
have no consideration of the fears of your friends for
you. Captain Howard, who is a man of great experience
on the frontier, thinks your life is not worth
an hour’s purchase after our departure, and I, myself,
who am no alarmist, feel that if we leave you
here I look upon you for the last time.”</p>

<p>Despite Raymond’s self-control, he was greatly
harried during this speech by the antics of a young
tribesman, who had taken up his position on the other
side of Mr. Morton and was reproducing in grisly
caricature every word and gesture of the British
officer—even to the motions of the cocked hat in
his hand. The ensign had uncovered in token of
his respect and as he talked he gesticulated, in his
earnestness, with the hat. In the florid imitation
of mockery the Indian permitted Mr. Morton’s hat,
which he himself held, to sharply graze, in one of his
flourishes, the pallid cheek of the aged minister. It
was in effect a buffet, and Raymond gave a quick
audible gasp, recovering with difficulty his impassive
demeanor.</p>

<p>“My dear young sir,” said the old man, “I have
stanch friends among these good people, who will
not see me evilly entreated. I cannot put aside—I
cannot postpone the Lord’s work to a more convenient
season. I must remain—I must repair
the damage to the faith of these new Christians done
by their chief’s crafty cross-questioning of the commandant
to-day. I must not leave my sheep to the
lion, the weaklings of all my flock to the ravening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
wolves of doubt. I must be with them—but have
no fears for me. I have twice been bound to the
stake, and yet came safely off.”</p>

<p>Raymond was at his wits’ end. There was a shifting
in the crowds. They were converging down the
sunny slope toward the river-bank. Beyond their
heads he caught a gleam of scarlet against the shining
current, near the white flashing of the swans’
wings as the great birds rose in flight. The soldiers
were embarking. There came to his ears the loud,
guttural voice of the chief of the town, Rolloweh,
pronouncing the sonorous periods of his official
farewell to Captain Howard. Time pressed. The
response of the captain would be curt and concise,—there
was scant utility to mint phrases for Rolloweh,—and
Raymond could well divine that the
commandant was sick at heart. On the smooth
spaces of the “beloved square” there lingered those
inimical plotting groups, still whispering, still casting
speculative glances at the missionary and the ensign,
still waiting, Raymond faithfully believed, to seize
the old man and bear him to his doom, before the
English boats should be a furlong down the river.</p>

<p>The ensign’s patience, never a formidable endowment,
gave way suddenly. He clapped his hat on
his head with a nonchalant flap. He turned a burning
eye on two stalwart young soldiers of his escort
and spoke but one short phrase, with a significant
gesture. The intelligent fellows comprehended the
extraordinary order in an instant. With light willing
steps they ran forward, bent down, seized the Reverend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
Mr. Morton in their strong young arms, lifted him
bodily, and at a swift, sure, steady run they set out
with their captive for the river-bank, their young
officer close on their heels calling out in Cherokee,
with glad bursts of laughter, “The ‘beloved man’
shall be removed!”</p>

<p>The whole community was in an uproar. The
culmination came so suddenly, with no sort of warning,
that the crowds by the water-side, remembering
the urgency of the chiefs that the “beloved man”
should be removed, fell in with the apparent spirit
of the exploit and shouted and laughed as at some
rude jest and boisterous horse-play. The conspirators
of the “beloved square” did not catch the significance
of the incident for one brief moment of
stunned surprise, roused as they were from the absorptions
of their secret plottings, but though they came
howling their baffled rage and vengeance and frenzied
protests hard upon Raymond’s party, that one moment
saved the life of the Reverend Mr. Morton.
Their voices were overborne in the joyous clamors
of the populace, not yet admitted into the plans of
revenge, and chorusing the ensign’s jocular mockeries.
Raymond, himself standing in the bow of the pettiaugre
and urging his crew,—“Push off—Let
fall—Back oars—Row—Pull, lads, pull for your
lives!” in a half-stifled undertone of excitement, did
not feel that the return trip was a possibility till the
pettiaugre reached the centre of the shining stream,
then turning southward caught the current and began
to slip and glide along as fast as oar could ply, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the momentum of the stream could aid. Even then
a rifle ball came whizzing past.</p>

<p>“It is nothing,” said Captain Howard, reassuringly—“some
lawless miscreant. The head-men intend
no demonstration.”</p>

<p>The plans of the conspirators, divulged in that
moment of embarkation, had mightily caught the
fancy of the “mad young men” of the assemblage—that
class on whom the Cherokee rulers charged
the responsibility of all the turmoils and riots, those
who fought the battles and endured the hardships,
and carried out the treacherous enterprises and
marauding massacres which the head-men secretly
planned and ordered and abetted. Some who had
just been rollicking with laughter came running
after the boats along the bank, their breath short,
their features swelled with savage rage, their eyes distended
with futile ferocity. Some were crying
out mockeries, and blasphemies, and furious maledictions
on the head of the old missionary, and
others, among whom were the conspirators of the
“beloved square,” were protesting craftily that the
missionary was abducted against his will and was to
be carried as a prisoner to Fort Prince George—adjuring
the commandant to permit him to return
and threatening force to stop the boats if he were
not immediately set ashore.</p>

<p>“We shall meet them, sir, when we round the
bend,” said Raymond, in a low voice to Captain
Howard, for the river made a deep swirling curve
around a considerable peninsula, and a swift runner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
cutting straight across this tongue of land would
have little difficulty in anticipating the passing of
the pettiaugre, although the men were bending to
the oars with every muscle stretched, and the iterative
impact of the strokes was like the rapid ticking
of a clock.</p>

<p>As the boats came shooting with an arrowy swiftness
around the peninsula, an Indian, the foremost
runner, was already there, standing high on a rock.
His figure on the promontory, distinct against the
blue sky with his hands up-stretched, the palms
together, ready to spring and dive, was visible from
far off. He looked back over his shoulder to make
sure that other Cherokees were following, then timing
his adventure with incredible precision, he sprang
into the water with a great splash, was invisible a
few seconds, and came up alongside the pettiaugre,
with a hand on the gunwale, near the bow.</p>

<p>A hundred braves, almost all armed, stood at
gaze on the lower banks, a trifle blown by the swift
pace, a score or two laying aside their weapons, apparently
preparatory to entering the water. The
soldiers, well within rifle range, all frontier veterans,
young though they were, as obedient and as unmoved
as parts of a mechanism, rowed steadily on, disregarding
their muskets, stowed in the bottom of the pettiaugre.
Only the man nearest the Indian, hanging to
the boat, contrived in a lengthened stroke to hit the
pendulous legs some heavy covert blows with a feathered
oar, which, sooth to say, might have broken
less stalwart limbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Ensign,” suggested Robin Dora, in the bow,
plaintively, “wad it fash your honor gif I dinged that
fist a clout wi’ ae drum-stick? It’s gey close to
my shoulther.”</p>

<p>“Be silent,” said Raymond, severely, and Robin
Dora subsided, even ceasing to glance over his shoulder
at the uncanny hand so close to his arm.</p>

<p>Captain Howard, in the haste of embarkation had
taken his place in Raymond’s boat, and his own
had fallen under the conduct of the adjutant. It followed
like a shadow the craft in the lead, as silent
as a shadow, as swift. Captain Howard had not by
virtue of his rank assumed command, the crew being
already organized. He earnestly desired to provoke
no attack from the Indians, but he expected it momently,
and fingered his pistols in his belt as he eyed
the gathering tribesmen on shore; under these circumstances
he was in doubt as to his wisest course;
the impunity of the figure clinging to the boat invited
recruits, yet to it Raymond gave not a glance.
Captain Howard was moved to a comment.</p>

<p>“You give transportation to passengers, Ensign?”
he queried.</p>

<p>“It seems so, sir,” Raymond replied, succinctly.</p>

<p>It had evidently been the plan of the Indians to
send out swimmers to the boats, and demand and
secure the return of the missionary on the pretext
that he was torn from them against his own
desire, and if the crew dared to refuse, despite the
coercion of the rifles of the hundreds on shore, the
swimmers were to upset the craft, seize their prey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
and make for the main body. The leader had far
out-stripped his following, and his zeal had jeopardized
the practicability of the feat. He had given
the little British force the opportunity to make a
great display of coolness and indifference. The contempt
with which their demonstration was treated
disconcerted the Cherokees, who relished naught so
much as the terrors their presence was wont to inspire,—the
surprise, the agitation, and commotion
that were the sequence of their sudden attacks.</p>

<p>The crowd on shore stood at gaze, watching the
unexpected scene—the Indian clinging like a reptile
to the boat, while its keel cleft the clear brilliant
waters, and the silent crew rowed like men spurting
for a prize. Suddenly the Indian, belabored possibly
beyond endurance by an eccentric oar, made
a movement as though he would spring into the boat.
Raymond swiftly leaned forward, and with a courteous
manner, as of offering aid, caught the Cherokee’s
arm with a grip like steel, and fairly lifted him
into the pettiaugre.</p>

<p>The Indian stood for a moment, staring at the calm
faces of his enemies. Had he been fifty instead of
one the matter might have resulted far more seriously,
but his fellows had not followed; their plans had not
matured; they stood doubtful, watching the results
of his effort and its futility, for he was going straight
down the river as a prisoner to Fort Prince George.
He looked bewildered, agitated, glanced wildly from
one to another, then as if fearing detention leaped
high into the air, fell into the water, and struck out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
for the shore as fast as his limbs might carry him,
while the tribesmen on the bank, whom he had expected
to lead, burst into derisive cries, and laughter,
and gay buffoonery.</p>

<p>It was the turn of the tide; it was the trifle that so
often broke the designs of the inconstant Indians.
The two officers knew that the game was played out
when they heard, far up-stream, so fast was their
progress, the shouts of raillery and ridicule as the
adventurous wight waded ashore.</p>

<p>“Very well managed, Ensign Raymond,” said
Captain Howard, laughing with comfortable reassurance.
“It might have been much more serious.”</p>

<p>“But is this well, Captain Howard?” said the deep
melancholy voice of the missionary. “I am a British
subject. I have done naught to forfeit my independence
of action, my liberty. I am made a
prisoner, and torn from my sacred work and my
chosen habitation against my will. I am in no sense
within your jurisdiction or under your control as
commandant of Fort Prince George, and I protest
against this infringement of my rights as most unwarrantable
tyranny.”</p>

<p>Captain Howard, who happened to be standing
in the pettiaugre, and being a landsman had no sea
legs to speak of, toppled to and fro in his surprise and
agitation, and had he not fallen instead against the
bulk of a tall and burly oarsman he might have fallen
overboard. He hastened to place himself on a seat,
and then, red-faced, dumbfounded, and sputtering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
with half a dozen phrases that tumbled over each
other in his amazement he exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“My God! sir, do I understand you? Can I
believe my ears? Are you not with us now by your
own free will, the exercise of your own mature judgment?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, no, sir, as I have already stated,” said
the old man, with dignity. “Did you not see, sir,
that I was literally carried to the boat in the arms of
soldiers under the command of your own officer?”</p>

<p>“By God Almighty, sir,” declared the agitated
commandant, “I swear when I saw you carried in
the arms of the soldiers I supposed it was in a measure
to shield you from the fury and malevolence of the
Indians. Ensign Raymond,” he turned upon the
young officer, who was calm enough to stand steadily,
“you shall answer for this. I empowered you only
to invite, to persuade Mr. Morton to come with us.”</p>

<p>“And I did persuade him, sir,” Raymond stoutly
averred.</p>

<p>“Do you define ‘persuasion’ as the kidnapping
of a minister of God? Damme, but you shall answer
for this!”</p>

<p>“I am more than willing, sir, to endure any punishment
that I may have deserved,” Raymond replied,
downcast and dreary. It seemed to him that
he was now always under the ban of reprimand.
“But to leave Mr. Morton there was to my mind like
committing murder on a minister of God when I have
the means to bring him away.”</p>

<p>Captain Howard had a sudden recollection of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
faces of hate and craft, the frenzied foolish reasoning,
the fateful ferocity of temperament. He shuddered
even yet for the old man’s sake.</p>

<p>“You ought to have had the reverend gentleman’s
consent,” he said more mildly.</p>

<p>“It is hard to be old and poor, and of no earthly
consideration,” plained the old man. “My consent
was very easily dispensed with. But—I <i>am</i> a
British subject!”</p>

<p>“He ought to have <i>given</i> his consent,” Raymond
boldly replied to Captain Howard, “and saved one
who only sought to do him kindness from the necessity
of incurring ignominy for his sake. But I care
not,” he continued, doggedly, tossing his head in its
cocked hat. “I should liefer have taken his life,
old and gray as he is, than have left him where he
stood, if art, or force, or persuasion failed to get him
away. No—no, I could not leave him there—if
I am to be broke for it!” he declared with passion.</p>

<p>The generous temper of the old missionary was
reasserted, although the smart in his heart for his
deserted Indian sheep was keen. He looked up
wistfully, anxiously, at the young officer who stood
in the shadow of discipline, of professional ruin,
perhaps, on his account. Oh, it was not his mission
to wound, to drag down; but to bind up, to assuage,
to save. He spoke suddenly and with a different
intonation.</p>

<p>“You intended a benefit, doubtless, young sir.
You urged me first with every argument in your power,
I admit. You found it hard and not without danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
to yourself to persist so long, till indeed the very
moment of departure. You shall incur no rebuke
nor ignominy on my account. Your methods of
‘persuasion,’ it is true, are somewhat arbitrary,” he
added with a wintry smile. “But, Captain Howard,
I call you to witness—and soldiers, bear witness,
too—I accompany this expedition of my own free
will, for doubtless the commandant, after what he
has said, would put me ashore if I so desired. I am
going to Fort Prince George on the invitation of the
commandant very thankfully, and I am grateful to
this kind young man for ‘persuading’ me.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand to Raymond, who was still
standing. The ensign was startled by this sudden
change, and touched by the look in the old man’s
face. He made haste to offer his hand in response,
and sank down on one knee beside the seat to obviate
the distance between them. Suddenly Raymond
became aware of that which in the stress of the embarkation
and the unusual excitement of their progress
down the river had escaped the notice both of
officers and soldiers—the fact that in the rapid
progress across the “beloved square” some heavy
missile unnoticed in the mêlée had inflicted a severe
bruise and cut on the face of the old man; a livid
line, ghastly and lacerated, extended almost from
brow to chin. It had bled freely, and wisps of the
thin gray hair were matted upon the wrinkled brow,
even more pallid than its wont, for the shock had been
severe, inducing for some little time a state of semi-insensibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>At the sight of this Raymond cried out sharply,
as if he, himself, had been struck; the blood surged
swiftly into his face; his heart beat almost to suffocation;
he looked piteously into the faded, gentle
eyes, full of that sanctity which hallows a stainless
old age. The sense of sacrilege and horror overcame
him.</p>

<p>“Those fiends have wounded you!” he exclaimed,
in the low, appalled, staccato tones of intense excitement.
Suddenly his eyes filled, and hiding his
face against the worn sleeve of the old clergyman’s
coat, he burst into a flood of tears, his shoulders
shaking with his sobs.</p>

<p>Captain Howard stared in blunt and absolute
amaze, but Mr. Morton, better accustomed to ebullitions
of emotion, only gently patted the soldier’s
scarlet coat as if he were a child.</p>

<p>“I hope you will be more careful how you persuade
people after this,” said the commandant, with the
manner of improving a moral lesson. Now, however,
that Captain Howard had recovered somewhat from
the shock of the interference with the liberty of a
British subject, he was disposed to congratulate himself
on the fact that he had the missionary hard and
fast in the boat, and to think that Raymond had conducted
himself in a dilemma almost insoluble with
extraordinary promptitude, resource, and nerve, and
to be rather proud of the subaltern’s ready aplomb.</p>

<p>As to the tears—they were incomprehensible to
Captain Howard, and by the rank and file they were
deemed a disgrace to the service. The soldiers could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
not enter into Raymond’s complex emotions, and they
were at once the source of wonder and disparagement.</p>

<p>When the discipline which had prevailed at the
outset was somewhat relaxed, and the men at the
rowlocks, still pulling steadily down the river, were
free to talk in subdued voices, the events of the day
were canvassed with much spirit. The personality
of various Indians was discussed, certain parties
from the upper towns were recognized by soldiers
who had seen more than one campaign in this region,
the jeopardy of the occasion was argued, individual
experiences narrated, threats that had been overheard
were repeated, and it was agreed that the ensign’s
little party had been in great danger during
the progress of the “persuasion”—they all grinned
at the word. Then one of the young giants who had
performed the feat of abduction, remarked—“But
I always feel safe with the ensign. Somehow he
allus gits the short cuts.”</p>

<p>“I did too—<i>thin</i>; more fool, me! Begorra, I
niver dhramed he was such a blasted babby!”</p>

<p>They giggled at the word, and when their rations
were served, it was pleasant to old Mr. Morton and
the officers to see such hilarity among the honest
fellows. They could not divine the men were badgering
the quarter-master-sergeant from time to time
to know why no “sago-gruel” or “sugar-sops” had
been provided for the nourishment of the “babby”
they had in command, and threatening to report the
deficiency to Captain Howard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>Raymond had recovered his serenity. He had
snatched up the hat of the old missionary, when the
mimicking Indian had tossed it on the ground, and
now he tenderly helped him to adjust it. As the boat
glided on into the sunset waters, enriched with the
largess of the sunset sky, and the tranquil evening
came on apace, and the shadows leaned far across the
western bank, the subjects that allured the old man’s
mind reasserted their fascination, and he talked on
with placid pleasure of the Hebraic origin of the
Indians, their possible identity with the “Lost Tribes,”
the curious similarity of certain of their religious
observances with the rites of the Mosaic dispensation,
and cognate themes, while Raymond punctiliously
listened, and Captain Howard dozed and nodded with
no more compunction than if he were in church.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> were the rejoicings at Fort Prince George
when the two pettiaugres pulled in with the tidings
that as yet the peace of the frontier was unthreatened.
The handful of troops that had garrisoned the British
fort on the verge of the Cherokee country had endured
their exile, the hardships of savage warfare,
the peculiar dangers that menaced them, the rude
conditions of their environment with a sturdy fortitude,
a soldierly courage, and a long patience. But
now that their return to the provinces was imminent,
preparations under way for the evacuation of the
post, marching orders expected by every express,
they could scarcely await, day by day, the approaching
event. They jealously scanned every current
incident lest a reason for a postponement lurk therein;
they canvassed every item of news from the Indian
country for signs of uprising; they took cognizance
of the personal traits of the men of influence among
the Cherokees, and in the guard-room and the galleries
of the barracks theorized and collogued together
on their mischief-making proclivities,—all
as these tended to affect the liberation from the
wilderness. Some of the soldiers were pathetically
pessimistic, and thought death or accident would
frustrate their participation in the joyous exodus.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
“I’m feared <i>something</i> will happen,” one protested.
“I’m fairly feared to cross the level parade, lest I fall
down on it and break my neck.” And a forlorn wight
in hospital, who had known serious wounds, and the
torture of the small-pox, and the anguish of a broken
limb, suffering now from a touch of malarial fever,
earnestly besought the chirurgeon daily to be frank
with him and let him know if his early demise would
keep him here forever.</p>

<p>Mervyn did not share the general eager anticipation
of the return of the expedition, and he deprecated
greatly that Raymond should have been at the
commandant’s ear before he, himself, should have
the opportunity to report the destruction of the
granary. That the ensign would make the most of his
supposed dereliction in the matter he did not doubt.
Since he had regained his composure and recouped
his self-esteem by the favorable reception of his suit
by Miss Howard, he had begun to realize that he had
let his wounded vanity carry him too far in his antagonism
toward Raymond. In the vexatious little
contretemps on the occasion of the dinner of welcome,
when, like an egregious coxcomb, he had seemed to
expect that her next words would be a practical avowal
of her preference for him, he had detected both divination
and ridicule in Raymond’s eyes. But this was
an untenable cause of quarrel. He had fallen, instead,
upon the omissions of the guard report, and he began
to be painfully aware that if Captain Howard knew
that this information, on which he had based his
report, had come to him merely through the gossip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
of his groom, <i>he</i> would have received the reprimand
instead of Raymond. He was particularly pleasant
to Jerrold, with that gracious unbending of the rich
and highly placed, as if in the main values of humanity
these fortuitous conditions count not at all. But
Lieutenant Jerrold was well aware that as officer
of the day he had fought the fire and saved the fort in
the absence of the acting commander, and he had
none of the fine-spun generosities of Raymond’s
character to induce him to disregard either a nettling
fact or an actual fault. He, too, was bland and inscrutable,
and Mervyn could not for his life divine
whether Captain Howard would be satisfied with the
cursory report of his captain-lieutenant, or would he
scan the reports of each tour of service during his
absence on the expedition.</p>

<p>To Mervyn’s amazement, the commandant met
at the gates of Fort Prince George the first intimation
of the burning of the granary, and the spirit
in which Captain Howard received it might indicate
that he expected to live exclusively on Indian meal
for the rest of his life. His quick, keen glance as
entering, he paused under the archway of the gate,
taking a cursory view of the whole place, fell upon
a vacancy where the gable of the granary used to
show from over the sheds of the stables. His eyes
widened, the blood surged up into his cheek, he
stepped forward two paces.</p>

<p>“My God!” he cried. “Where’s the granary,
Mervyn?”</p>

<p>The face of the captain-lieutenant flushed. Jerrold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
and Innis were both standing by, and it was
indeed hard that through no fault of his he should be
put at so gross a disadvantage.</p>

<p>“The granary is burned, sir,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Burned!” volleyed Captain Howard. “Who
burned it? Was this negligence?” he demanded,
sternly.</p>

<p>Mervyn had a sudden monition that Jerrold and
Innis were secretly commenting on the fact which
he, himself, was now contemplating with stunned
amazement, that Raymond had not made the most
of his opportunity to decry the captain-lieutenant
with a very valid cause.</p>

<p>“Raymond should have told you,” he began.</p>

<p>“Raymond has been busy.” Captain Howard
nodded his head succinctly.</p>

<p>“I thought he came here expressly for information
about the fire.”</p>

<p>“I am not asking you why Ensign Raymond did
not give me the information he was sent to gather.
I happen myself to know why. I ask you how that
granary came to be burned?”</p>

<p>“The lightning, sir,” said Mervyn, greatly offended
by the tone of his superior officer.</p>

<p>“And was it a total loss?” asked Captain Howard.</p>

<p>“A total loss, sir.”</p>

<p>Captain Howard set off at a resolute trot toward
the charred remains and stood gazing dolorously
down at the blackened, fallen heap of timbers and
the pile of ashes.</p>

<p>The sound of his familiar voice elicited a responsive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
whinny of pleasure from within the stables
close at hand, where his own charger stood at the
manger, unconscious of the possibilities of famine
that hung above his high-bred head.</p>

<p>“What are you doing for feed?”</p>

<p>“Buying from the Indians of Keowee Town—paying
six prices.”</p>

<p>Captain Howard shook his head disconsolately. During
the late war the public granaries of the Cherokees
had been destroyed by the British commands as punitive
measures and the people reduced to the verge
of starvation. The scanty crop of the past summer
by no means replaced those great hoards of provisions,
and in his report as to the store of corn he
would have remaining at the time of his departure
he had expressed his intention, entirely approved,
to bestow it as a parting gift upon the neighboring
town of Keowee. Now he, himself, was destitute,
and how to forage his force on the march through
the wilderness to Charlestown he could not yet
imagine.</p>

<p>Suddenly—“How did the horses stand it?”
Mervyn thought the ordeal would never end. To
answer in his capacity as captain-lieutenant, temporarily
in command, these strict queries in the presence
of men who knew that he had seen naught
of the event tried his nerve, his discretion, his ingenuity
to the utmost. He revolted at the mere simulacrum
of a deception, and yet he desired to report the
matter to Captain Howard when they should not
be at hand to hear his superior officer’s blunt comments.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
He felt that the unlucky chance owed him
this slight shield to his pride.</p>

<p>He had naturally expected that his report would
be made at the usual time and in the usual manner,
when he could explain properly the details and
account for his absence with seemliness and dignity.
He said to himself that no one could have foreseen
that instead of making the official inspection at
the regulation time the commandant would be
struck on the instant of his arrival by the absence
of the granary and fly over the whole place, peering
into every nook and squawking with excitement
like some old house-keeping hen of a woman. The
sight of the vacant place where the granary should
have stood seemed to affect his nerves as an apparition
might have done. He could not be through
quaking over it. Mervyn, however, gave no token
of the perturbation that filled his mind as he turned
to Jerrold.</p>

<p>“You were at the stables, lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“I had considerable trouble with the horses,” said
Jerrold. “They were terrified, of course, by the
noise and glare. I had them led out of the stalls,
thinking the stables might take fire.”</p>

<p>“Casualties?” sharply asked the captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, none, sir,” replied Jerrold, with dapper satisfaction.
He had managed with much address an
infinite number of details, depending on scanty resources
and urgently pressed for time—“Only one
horse, a good blood bay, became restive and kicked
down his stall and caught his off hind leg in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
timbers; somehow, in the mêlée it was broken, and
he had to be shot.”</p>

<p>“<i>Only</i> one horse,” Captain Howard commented
rebukingly. “Are we on the eve of a march? And
the war has left hardly a hoof in the whole Cherokee
country! Do you expect to foot it to Charlestown?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Jerrold asserted himself. He wished
to marry no one’s handsome daughter, and he
cared to play Piquet with no one’s clever sister.
He would be particular not to exceed the bounds of
military decorum, and that was his only consideration.
He knew that he had exerted himself to the
utmost to save the situation, succeeding almost
beyond the possibilities, the responsibility of which
devolved on another man. “I might well have lost
them all, sir. The rain had not begun. The store-house
and the armory were both on fire, I had no
help at first, for I dared not call off the main guard—you
had twenty stout fellows in the boats—and
the rest of the men were asleep in barracks; some
of them were pulled out of bed by the heels. By
your leave, Captain, one horse is a small tribute to
pay to such a lordly conflagration as that.”</p>

<p>The commandant, open to conviction, nodded
his head meditatively. Mervyn wondered if he
had not noticed the personal pronoun so obtrusive
in Jerrold’s account of the measures he had taken.
Mervyn had an ebullition of indignation against himself
as he recognized his own inmost thought. He
was so proud a man he would fain stand well with
himself. Had he not been so cautious a man, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
self-conscious, he would at the moment have blurted
out the fact of his absence, instead of steeling himself
against the waiting expectation, the cynical
comment in the eyes of Jerrold and Innis, and postponing
the disclosure till he was sure it could come
with a good grace. And then the blunt captain!
He could not submit his pride to the causticities of
Howard’s unprepared surprise and brusque comments.
He would say things for which he would be sorry
afterward, for which Mervyn would be more sorry,
and particularly that Jerrold and Innis should hear
them. He was angry with himself, nevertheless,
that he should give a galvanic start as Captain
Howard’s voice, keyed to surprise and objection,
struck smartly on the air.</p>

<p>“Why, that gun, there,” he said, waving his arm
toward one of the cannon on the nearest bastion—“that
gun has been fired!”</p>

<p>For the piece was run back on its chassis and stood
as it was left after the alarm. Jerrold made haste
to explain that the men who were detailed to the
service of this gun—there were only a few regular
gunners in the garrison—were with the expedition.
Mervyn stipulated that as the absence of a score had
left extra duty for the rest of the garrison the position
of this gun had happened to be neglected, although
it, as well as the rest, had been cleaned and
reloaded.</p>

<p>“Reloaded! But why were they discharged?” demanded
Captain Howard, with wide eyes.</p>

<p>The sight of the fire naturally attracted the attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
of the Indians—Jerrold explained. They
came over from Keowee in canoes by scores. He
was afraid that they would seize the opportunity
of the disaster while all were so busy with the fire to
rush the gates. He ordered the sentinels to disperse
them, saying the cannon were to be fired to appease the
storm gods. Any lie might be excused—there was
such a great crowd gathered as near as the counterscarp
in front of the gates. “How many Indians
had assembled there, do you think, Mervyn?”
Jerrold asked with a touch of mischief or malice.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I didn’t see them,” Mervyn responded,
shortly.</p>

<p>Captain Howard was meditating on the details.</p>

<p>“You must have had a devil of a time,” he said
with emphasis. “Do you know if the ladies were
much frightened?”</p>

<p>Mervyn was silent, but Jerrold with his crisp,
fresh, capable air was ready to take the word.</p>

<p>“I think they knew nothing of the fire and the
Cherokee demonstration till everything was over,”
he said.</p>

<p>“You did well—you did well!” the commandant
declared, addressing no one in particular, and Mervyn,
who could hardly say, “It was not I,” saw him, with
infinite relief, turn presently from the scene of these
incidents and take his way toward his own quarters,
with a belated monition that it was now in order to
greet his waiting family.</p>

<p>There the news met him of the notable capture
in his absence, for Mrs. Annandale had learned the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
particulars from her niece and was herself blissful
enough to be translated. In fact, so beaming, so
softened, so benign was she, that Captain Howard,
more gratified than he would have cared to acknowledge,
could not forbear a gibe at her vicarious
happiness.</p>

<p>“One would think you were to be the bride, Claudia,”
he said, laughing in great good-humor.</p>

<p>“With the handsome young husband, and Mervyn
Hall, and the Mervyn diamonds! But it’s
none too good for my treasure—the brightest, the
best, the most beautiful and winsome creature
that ever stepped!” She put her handkerchief to
her eyes, for those sardonic little orbs were full of
tears.</p>

<p>“She is—she is indeed!” cried Captain Howard.
He felt that no man could be worthy of Arabella.</p>

<p>“But now, <i>you</i> must be careful—don’t speak
as if it is absolutely settled. You know dear Arabella
is a bit freakish—”</p>

<p>She would have said—“perverse like you,” but
for the bliss that curbed her thoughts. But indeed
Captain Howard took the alarm on the
instant.</p>

<p>“Now, Claudia,” he said with earnest, remonstrating
eyes, “you are not persuading that child into
this rich marriage against her inclinations?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale looked for a moment six feet high—so
portentous was her dignity as she drew herself
up. “<i>I</i>” she said, in freezing accents, “<i>persuade!</i>”
with an infusion of contempt. “My good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
sir, <i>I</i> knew nothing whatever of his proposal of
marriage, till Arabella saw fit to confide in me!”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, I am sure—” began Captain
Howard.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> disregard her inclination—<i>I</i> who have sought
nothing but her happiness since her mother’s
death!” said Mrs. Annandale.</p>

<p>“True, true, my sister. And I always gratefully
remember this.”</p>

<p>He crossed the room, sat down beside her, and
took her hand. It was a tiny wrinkled hand, soft
and unsubstantial, suggestive of something uncanny,—a
mouse or a young chicken, that does not lend
itself to hearty pressure. Captain Howard’s gingerly
touch was more as if he felt her pulse than
clasped her hand.</p>

<p>She permitted herself to be reconciled, so benign
was her triumph.</p>

<p>“They settled it between them. <i>I</i> knew nothing of
it. It was during the storm. I was not in here. I
went to my room for my sal volatile partly, and
partly because I could not, without screaming,
see the lightning capering about like a streak of hell
turned loose on earth, and when I had done with my
vocalizes,”—she could afford to laugh at herself
on a fair day like this—“and came back, lo! here
were Corydon and Phyllis, smiling at each other, as
sentimental as you please!”</p>

<p>Captain Howard laughed with responsive satisfaction.
It was a relief to him to know that his
beautiful daughter would be so safely settled in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
world—that her path would be smoothed by all
that wealth and station could give. He had known
Mervyn all the young man’s life, and his father and
grandfather before him, and liked him well. He
thought him safe, steady, conservative, of good parts,
and a capable officer. Doubtless, however, he
would sell out of the army when he should come into
the title and estate, and Captain Howard was not
sorry for this, despite his own military predilections.
He was glad that Arabella’s lot should be cast in
the pleasant paths of English country life, instead
of following the British drumbeat around the world.
He was sensible, too, of a great pleasure in the fact
that her beauty, her cleverness, her careful education,—for
learning was the fad of the day among women
of fashion, and Miss Howard added to considerable
solid acquirements musical and linguistic accomplishments
of no mean order,—would all be conspicuously
placed in a setting worthy of their value
and calculated to enhance their lustre. She would
embellish the station as no Lady Mervyn heretofore
had ever graced it. As he sat gazing, half-smiling,
into the fire, he could hear echoes from the future—“The
beautiful and gifted Lady Mervyn,” she would
be called; “the clever Lady Mervyn,”—“the fascinating
and accomplished Lady Mervyn!” Life had
been good to her; the most extravagant wishes would
be fulfilled—wealth and station, love and beauty,
grace and goodness would all be hers. The father’s
heart swelled with gratification and paternal pride.</p>

<p>“How is she freakish?” he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“She will not let it be spoken of as if it were absolutely
settled. She says she does not know him
well enough. She has every opportunity to make
his acquaintance. He is at her feet all the day long.”</p>

<p>Only when his daughter herself spoke to him was
Captain Howard’s satisfaction dashed. He was a
blunt, straightforward man, and he did not comprehend
subtleties. He only felt them.</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Raymond tell you about the fire?” she
asked, apropos of nothing.</p>

<p>When he replied that he had learned of the
incident only after he had returned to the fort,
she looked at him searchingly, silently, her hazel eyes
grave and pondering as she sat beside him on the settle,
her hand in his. Then she edged closer and began to
pull and plait the bullion fringes of his nearest epaulet,
the clumsy decoration of those days, while the
white lids and long dark lashes drooped half over her
pensive eyes, and a slight flush rose in her cheek.</p>

<p>“Did he really tell you nothing of Mr. Mervyn’s
dispositions during the fire?”</p>

<p>“He did not mention Mervyn’s name,” Captain
Howard answered, and he was thinking this silence
significant—it intimated a sort of professional
jealousy on Raymond’s part, which was certainly an
absurd sentiment to be entertained by an ensign
toward the efficiency of a captain-lieutenant—for
the management of the fire and the interdependent
details had been admirable in every way. It gave
Captain Howard special pleasure to commend this
management, for he thought that surely if she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
cared for Mervyn such commendation would please
her. Certainly, as he doubtless would leave the army
soon, it mattered little now, whether or not he were
a capable officer, but the commandant had enough
feeling for his profession as the art of war to greatly
value efficiency in the abstract, and he had a martinet’s
stern conviction that whatever a man undertakes
to do should be a manly devoir, strictly rendered.</p>

<p>“Mervyn’s management of the fire and the demonstration
of the Indians was most excellent,” he said.
“It was an exceedingly difficult and nettling incident.
I really should not have been surprised if a band of
Cherokees had forced their way into the parade while
practically the whole force was busy fighting the fire,
and even if the Indians had been actuated by mere
curiosity in coming in, serious consequences might
have ensued, the place being at their mercy. He
showed excellent conduct—excellent.”</p>

<p>She stared at him with wide eyes, then her face
fell unaccountably.</p>

<p>“And Mr. Raymond said nothing,” she faltered.</p>

<p>He did not understand it at the time, and afterward
he pondered on the matter in futile irritation.
When the formal reports had been presented and
Mervyn had stated that in the clamors of the storm
he had heard naught of the uproar in the fort, and the
officer of the day had met the emergency as best he
could, Captain Howard, deeply mortified and greatly
disillusioned, cared less for the facts than that they
had been so long withheld. It was the business of
the officers on duty to deal with the difficulties as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
they were presented. But he asked Mervyn why he
had not mentioned the true state of the case in the
presence of Jerrold and Innis, when the matter was
being canvassed, since they must have perceived the
misunderstanding under which the commandant was
permitted to labor, and would draw most unflattering
conclusions. “You give those fellows a hank over
you,” he said, curtly.</p>

<p>He realized this even more definitely afterward
when he made his acknowledgments to Jerrold, as
he felt bound to do.</p>

<p>“I was under the impression that Captain Mervyn
had the conduct of the emergency,” he said, in much
embarrassment. “You managed it with excellent
discretion.”</p>

<p>“The men responded with so much good will and
alacrity, sir,” replied Jerrold, waiving the commendation
with an appropriate grace. “We needed hearts
and hands rather than a head. They deserve all the
credit, for they worked with superhuman energy.
And I want to ask you, sir, now that the subject is
broached, for some little indulgence for those who
were burned in their exertions. No one is much
hurt, but I thought some little extra, to show appreciation—”</p>

<p>“By all means—by all means,” said the commandant,
glad to be quit of the subject.</p>

<p>Captain Howard perceived now that it certainly
was not jealousy of Mervyn’s exploits which had
kept his name from Raymond’s lips, and he returned
unavailingly to his daughter’s strict questions as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
the young ensign’s silence on the subject, and her look
of pondering perturbation at his answer. He wondered,
too, why Raymond should have maintained
this silence on a theme calculated to be of most
peculiar relish to him, considering the acrimonious
disposition which Mervyn had shown in reporting so
trifling an omission in the guard report, necessitating
a reprimand, while Mervyn’s own lapse, without
being his fault in any way, was of a semi-ludicrous
savor, which was not in the least diminished by his
own self-conscious efforts to ignore it. He sent a
glance of covert speculation now and again toward
Raymond in the days that ensued as the young man
came and went in the routine duties of garrison life, but
saw him no more in his own parlor, and several times
Arabella openly asked what had become of Ensign
Raymond.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that she had imperiously declared
she would let nothing be considered settled, Mervyn
had contrived to give the impression to the officers
of the garrison that his suit had won acceptance with
Miss Howard. Thus it came about that when these
two walked on the ramparts together on a fair afternoon,
or when lights began to glimmer from the parlor
windows in the purple dusk, there was a realization
in the mess-room that the welcome might be scant
even for well-meaning intruders, so in those precincts
the cards were cut for Loo, and the punch was brewed,
and the evening spent much as before there was ever
a lovely lady and a lute’s sweet vibrations to gladden
the air at Fort Prince George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>Mrs. Annandale artfully fired the girl’s pride. Her
lover with a mingled delicacy and fervor expended his
whole heart in homage. With a dutiful throb of
pleasure she marked the tender content in her father’s
face, and these quiet days in the citadel of the old
frontier fort ought to have been the happiest of her
life—but yet—she wondered at Raymond’s silence!
It was too signal a disaster in the estimation of a
military man—that a garrison should fight for
their lives and shelter while their commander, for
whatever cause, was perdu—for the ensign to have
forgotten to mention it. Was he so magnanimous?
Her eyes dwelt on the fire wistfully. This was not a
grace that Mervyn fostered. Why did Raymond
come no more? Sometimes she looked out of the
window on the parade to mark when he passed.
Once in a flutter and a flurry, when she would not
take time to think, she threw a fur wrap about her,
drawn half over her head, and stole out with Norah,
wrapped in a blanket shawl, and stood in a corner of
the bastion beside the ramp that ascended to the
barbette, and watched him as he put the troops
through the manual exercise on the parade. He
noticed neither of them. He was absorbed in his
work—they might both have been the laundry-maids.
Arabella was afraid of her aunt’s keen
questions that night in Mrs. Annandale’s bedroom
when Norah broke forth with her gossip of the garrison
and her comments on the drill.</p>

<p>“Oh, faix, mem, an’ it would gladden the heart av
yez ter see how nimble the men do sthep when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
drum rowls out so grand! I wonder yez don’t come
wid me an’ our young leddy to look at them, sure!”</p>

<p>“It will do <i>you</i> no good to look at the men, and for
me to look at them will do <i>them</i> no good. And a
sure way to make them step nimble is to set a mob of
red-skins after them—push up that stool, girl. Art
you going to set my silk stocking on the rough stone?”</p>

<p>“An’ shure it’s that hot,” declared the plump,
good-natured Norah, trying its temperature with her
hand, “it might bur-rn the wee, dilikit fut av yez,
mem.”</p>

<p>She adjusted the stool and recommenced.</p>

<p>“Shure, mem, I doesn’t belave thim gossoons
would run fur red-skins at their heels—the lave of
’em are Oirish!”</p>

<p>“And they haven’t got sense enough to run,”
commented the mistress. “What d’ye peel my hose
that way for, you vixen—you’ll take the skin as
well as the stocking!”</p>

<p>“An’ they does the goose-sthep mos’ beautiful, mem,
an’ mark time illigint. But that was for punishment,—caught
in Keowee Town, gambling wid the
Injuns. Larry O’Grady an’ a shquad war kep at ut,
mem, for hours by Ensign Raymond’s ordhers, Pat
Gilligan tould me, till they wuz fit to shed tears.”</p>

<p>“Shed tears—the hardened wretches!” said Mrs.
Annandale, interested nevertheless, <i>faute de mieux</i>,
in the simple annals of the garrison. For the days
were monotonous, and even Arabella, who one might
deem had much to think of, were it only to join George
Mervyn in planning the alterations at Mervyn Hall and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the details of her future reign, lingered to listen beside
her aunt’s fire, lounging in a great chair, dressed in
faint blue, and slipping languidly from one hand to
the other her necklace of pearls, her beautiful eyes a
little distrait, a little sad, it might seem, fixed on the
glowing coals.</p>

<p>“Shure, mem, weepin’ is all the fashion in the garrison
now. Since Ensign Raymond shed tears in public
the tale of it tickles the men so that if a finger be
p’inted at one of ’em a whole shquad av ’em ’ll bust
out sobbin’ an’ wipin’ their eyes,—but Sergeant
Kelly says if they don’t quit ut, be jabbers, he’s
give ’em something to cry fur.”</p>

<p>“You insolent wretch!” squealed Mrs. Annandale,
“how dare you say ‘be jabbers’ in my presence?”</p>

<p>“Shure, mem, ’twuz Sergeant Kelly shpakin’—not
me,” said Norah, well frightened.</p>

<p>“Sergeant Kelly ’shpakin’ here in my room, you
limb!”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Annandale could not divert the inquiry—she
would fain expunge the very name of Raymond
from the rolls.</p>

<p>“How did Ensign Raymond happen to shed tears?”
demanded Arabella, stiffly.</p>

<p>“Shure, Miss Arabella, the sojer bhoys does say
that whin the ould jontleman preacher-man wouldn’t
lave the Injuns,—an’ it’s a quare taste in folks he
have got, to be sure,—an’ the captain, with the
soft heart av him, cudn’t abide to lave him there,
this young ensign,—though if he didn’t hould his
head so high, an’ look loike he thought he was a lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
or a juke, he’d be a most enticin’-faced young man,—he
was ordered to pershuade the missionary to come.
An’ he just shwooped down on the riverend man of
God and bodily kidnapped him. I am acquainted
with the men that he ordhered to carry the ould
jontleman to the boat.”</p>

<p>“I think you are acquainted with the whole garrison,”
snapped Mrs. Annandale.</p>

<p>“Shure, there’s but foive other white women in
the place, an’ they are mostly old and married, an’
though I’m not called of a good favor at home I’ll
pass muster on the frontier,” and Norah simpered,
and actually tossed her head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale would have preferred dealing with
this insubordinate levity, and vanity, and disrespect
on the spot to returning to the subject of Raymond,
but the question had been Arabella’s, and the maid
did not wait for its repetition.</p>

<p>“An’ when they had got the cr-razy ould loon in
the boat—savin’ his honor’s riverence, but to want
to stay wid thim Injuns!—he shpake up pitiful an’
said he was ould, an’ feeble, an’ poor—or they
wouldn’t have dared to thrate him so! An’ Ensign
Raymond axed his forgiveness, an’ whin he giv it,
Ensign Raymond drapped down on one knee, an’
laid his head on the ould man’s ar-rm, an’ bust into
tears! Think o’ that, mem! The men all call him
now—Ensign Babby!”</p>

<p>Norah lifted a fresh, smiling, plump face and Mrs.
Annandale sent up a keen, high cackle of derision.
Then she stole a covert glance at her niece. Arabella,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
too, was smiling as she gazed into the fire—a soft
radiance had transfigured her face. Her beautiful
eyes were large, gentle, wistful, and—since emotion
was the fashion of the hour—they were full of
limpid tears, so pure, so clear, that they did not
obstruct the smile that shone through them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale was not sentimental herself, but
she was familiar with sentiment in others, and its
proclivities for the destruction of peace. Aided by
the fortuitous circumstances of the man’s absence and
Mervyn’s monopoly of Arabella’s society, she had been
as thoughtful, as far-sighted, as cautious as if she had
custody of the treasure of a kingdom, but she determined
that she would be more on her guard hereafter,
and never let the mention of the man’s name intrude
into the conversation. She fell into a rage over her
disrobing on slight provocation, and hounded and
vilified Norah to her pallet with such rancor that the
girl, who had been in high spirits, and felt that she
had contributed much this evening to the entertainment
of her employer, followed the lachrymose
tendencies of the mode, and softly sobbed herself to
sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day only it was that, George Mervyn
being on duty as officer of the day, Arabella felt
a dreary sort of freedom in being alone. A realization
that this lassitude, yet sense of relief, was no
good augury for her future oppressed her. She said
to herself that doubtless when she should be married
to him she would soon have less of his society. She
knew few marriages in which the devotion was so
constant as to grow wearisome; she thought it was
because of the intensity of his affection that she felt
it a drag. She declared with a sigh that she liked
him—she liked him well. She did not realize how
much her pride had predisposed her to entertain his
protestations, her aunt’s artful goadings, her own
ambitions, and her inherited disposition to persist,
to press forward against resistance, to conquer.</p>

<p>She wanted to be out—away, far from the scenes
with which he was associated, apart from the thought
of him. She wanted to regain her old identity—to
be herself—to feel free.</p>

<p>She was in haste as she donned her bottle-green
rokelay, for the weather was keen, and she had a
calash of the same dark tint, bordered with brown
fur that made a distinct line along the roll of her fair
hair above her brow. She went out alone upon the
ramparts, walking very swiftly, catching a glimpse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
through the embrasures, as she severally passed the
cannon, of the cold, steel-gray river, the leafless woods
bending before the blast, the ranges of mountains, all
dull brown or slate-gray save far, so far they hardly
seemed real, mere pearl-tinted illusions in the sombre
north. She caught her breath in deep quick respirations;
she heard how rapidly her footsteps sounded
on the hard-beaten red clay. She said that it was
exercise she had wanted, the fresh air, to be out,
the privilege every creature enjoyed—that bird, an
eagle, cleaving the air with his great wings; a party
of Indians on the opposite bank, going into the woods
in a regular jog-trot, single file; the very garrison dogs;
a group of men at the great gate. And suddenly she
threw up her arm and hailed this group, for she had
recognized her father among them.</p>

<p>She had recognized another—it was Raymond,
and she wondered that she had identified him at the
distance. The sentinel first perceived her gesture
and called Captain Howard’s attention. The party
paused, stared at the approaching, flying figure on
the ramparts, then as she reached a ramp and rushed
down the steep incline to the parade they came forward
at a fair pace to meet her.</p>

<p>“Lord, papa!” she cried breathlessly, “where are
you going? Let me go with you, sir, wherever it is.
Truly, sir, I am perishing for a breath of change. I
feel as if I have lived in Fort Prince George since
America was discovered. Let me go, sir!”</p>

<p>She had him by the arm now, and he was looking
down leniently at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“You are a spoil-sport, Arabella. You cannot go
where we are going, child.”</p>

<p>“Then go somewhere else,” she insisted. “Sure,
sir, I’m not a prisoner of war. Let me through that
gate, or I shall die of Fort Prince George.”</p>

<p>“We are going to speak to one of the chiefs of
Keowee Town about an important matter—feed for
the pack animals; we must have feed, you know, or
we shall never get away from Fort Prince George.”</p>

<p>“Across the river! Oh, bless us and save us,
papa, I <i>must go</i>. I could sit in the canoe while you
bargain, or confer, or what not. You would be near
at hand and I should not be afraid.”</p>

<p>“It is under the guns of the fort, sir,” suggested
Raymond.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Mr. Raymond, for the word!”
she cried. “Papa, I am going! All for Keowee,
follow me!”</p>

<p>As she whisked through the gates the sentinel presented
arms ostensibly to the party of officers, but
so promptly that it had the savor of a special compliment
to her as she passed in the lead. The frozen
ground was so hard beneath her flying feet, the wind
struck so chill on her cheek, the sparkle in her eyes
was so bright, the timbre of her clear, reedy, joyous
tones was so youthful, so resonant, that she seemed
indeed like some liberated thing. Mervyn’s monotonous
discourse of himself, his views, his hopes, his
experiences, recurred with a sarcastic suggestion to
Raymond’s mind, albeit he, himself, had entered into
these subjects with a fraternal warmth and interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
in the days of their devoted friendship, and he reflected
that an affectionate feeling for an egotist
blunts the sharp point of the obtrusive pronoun.</p>

<p>He was suffering a blended poignancy of pain and
pleasure in this unexpected meeting. He had already
discovered the depth of his feeling for the commandant’s
daughter before the expedition to Tamotlee.
On his return he had heard the gossip as to the
engagement, and realized that his love was hopeless.
It had taken a strong hold upon him, and he needed
all his courage to sustain the disappointment, the
disillusionment, for he had dreamed that he might
have found favor, the despair. He told himself
sternly that he had been a fool from the beginning.
She looked higher, naturally, than an ensign of foot,
who had scarcely any resources but his commission,—the
meagre pay of a subaltern. The very idea,
reasonably considered, was a death-blow to any
hope of speedy marriage. As the ensign was of good
birth his lowly estate seemed only to illustrate his
unworthiness of his distinguished lineage. All the
remote ancestral splendors that the Heralds’ College
could show were of scant worldly utility to an ensign
of foot. Nevertheless, he relished the fact that
Mervyn had paid him the compliment to be bitterly
jealous of him, and he saw in Mrs. Annandale’s disingenuous
little face that she feared him and his
attractions, whatever she might esteem these endowments,
beyond measure.</p>

<p>He had told himself that he ought to rejoice in the
young lady’s good fortune, that she should be so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
worthily placed; that if Mervyn’s wealth and station
could serve her interest this would demonstrate a
purpose in his creation, hitherto doubtful. He did
not deny himself the illogical grudging of this fair
creature to Mervyn with an infinite rancor. He had
never seemed so unworthy of her as now, failing even
in fair words, just dues, which most men contrive to
pay. Raymond had held his peace, however, when
Mervyn had been bitterly disparaged among the
little cluster of brother officers in the mess-hall, and
kept away from the commandant’s parlor, denying
himself even the pleasure of a formal call. It was
not well that he should see her, for his own sake—the
mere recollection of the contour of her face, the
pensive fall of her eyelash, the clear lustre of her eyes,
broke his heart, and shook his nerve, and half-maddened
his brain. He did not think that she might
miss him, might care for his coming. She loved Mervyn,
or thought she did, and he, himself, loved her so
well as to hope that she might never wear out that
illusion. Now, however, that he was with her again,
through no volition of his own, mere chance, his
heart plunged, his cheek flushed, his poor, denied,
famished love renewed its tremors, its vague, vain
hopes, its tumultuous delight in her mere presence.</p>

<p>As they crossed the bridge, and passed the counterscarp,
and took their way toward the glacis, he hastened
to offer his arm to support, after the fashion of
the day, the young creature, bounding on so lightly
ahead of them, for no woman of quality was esteemed
stalwart enough to dispense with man’s upholding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
strength. Reminded thus of etiquette Miss Howard
accepted the proffer, and leaning graciously upon
him, she somewhat slackened her pace as they crossed
the glacis and turned down the slope toward the
river.</p>

<p>The animation of the expedition seemed suddenly
monopolized by Captain Howard and his colleagues—the
quarter-master and the fort-adjutant, discussing
loudly ways and means, the respective values of
varieties of forage, the possibility of caches of corn
among the Indians, their obvious relish of the commandant’s
destitution when he most needed feed for
his pack-trains, and his march in the evacuation
of the fort. He had been told more than once
how they wished they had now the vast stores burned
by the British commander, Colonel Grant, in his
furious forays through the Cherokee country two
years previous—they would bestow it on the Capteny
without money and without price.</p>

<p>Scarcely a word passed between the young people.
Arabella, to her amazement, felt her hand so tremble
on Raymond’s arm that she was constrained to furnish
an explanation by a shiver and an exclamation
on the chill of the day. She could not understand
her own agitation. She felt the silence to be awkward,
conscious, yet she dared not speak, lest her
voice might falter. He, the dullard, had no divination
of her state of mind. It never occurred to him
to doubt the truth of the reported engagement. The
smug satisfaction which the face of the captain-lieutenant
now wore, despite the blight which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
military laurels had suffered, was a sufficient confirmation
of the truth of the rumor he had set afloat.
It never occurred to Raymond that undue persuasion
had been exerted upon her—he never dreamed that
Mrs. Annandale’s meagre little personality stood
for a strategist of a subtlety never before seen in the
Cherokee country, that she was capable of making
the young lady believe herself in love with George
Mervyn, and her father accept the fact on his sister’s
statement. Raymond could but mark the flushed,
conscious look now on Arabella’s face, the sudden
timidity in her downcast eyes, the tremor of her
daintily-gloved fingers on his arm. A sudden gust
blew a perfumed tress of her waving golden hair
over the brown fur and the dark green cloth of her
calash, whence it escaped, and thence across his cheek
for a moment. Its glitter seemed to blind him. He
caught his breath at its touch. But the next moment
they had reached the rocky declivity to the river-bank,
and he was all assiduity in finding a practicable
path amongst the intricacies of ledges and boulders,
over which she could have bounded with the sure-footed
lightness of a gazelle.</p>

<p>The long stretches of the still, gray river, flecked
with white foam, wherever an unseen rock lay submerged
beneath its full floods, reflected a sky of like
dreary tone. One could see movement above, as the
fleecy gray folds, that seemed to overlay a denser
medium of darker shade, shifted and overlapped,
thickened and receded noiselessly, a ceaseless vibrating
current, not unrelated to the joyless, mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
rippling of the waters. The leafless trees on the
banks looked down at their stark reflections in the
stream that intensified the riparian glooms—here
and there a grim gray promontory of solid rock
broke the monotony with an incident not less grave.
Mists hung in the air above the conical roofs of the
Indian town on the opposite bank, not easily distinguished
from the smoke issuing from the smoke-holes,
for chimneys they had none. No sound came
across the water; the town might have been asleep,
deserted, dead. As the party reached the bank a gust
came driving through the open avenue of the river,
damp with the propinquity of the body of water, shrill
with the compression of the air between the wooded
banks, and so strong that it almost swept Arabella
from her feet, and she clung to Raymond for support.
Her father renewed his protests against her venturing
forth upon the water—it might rain, if indeed it
were not too cold for this,—and urged her to return
to the fort, and await a fair day for an excursion on
the river.</p>

<p>In reply she pertinently reminded him that this
was no time to deny her whims, when she had come
out all the way from England to visit him. Indeed,
she did not wait for a denial. She stepped instantly
into the boat as soon as the soldiers who were to row
had taken their oars and brought it alongside, and as
she seated herself in the stern, Captain Howard could
only console his fears for her safety by wrapping her
snugly in a great fur mantle and listening to her feats
of prowess as she was good enough to detail them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Apparently she had suddenly found all her facility
in words, mute as she had been during the walk,
and it seemed to Raymond, as he wistfully eyed her
from the opposite seat, that she had said nothing
then because she had nothing to say to him.</p>

<p>“Sure, papa, I’m neither sugar nor salt. I shan’t
melt, except into tears for your cruelties. I am not
such a dainty, flimsy piece of dimity as all that comes
to. Why, when we crossed the sea every soul on
board was sick—except <i>me</i> and the men that
worked the ship. And there was wind, no capful
like this, but blowing great guns—and water!
the waves went all over us—the water came into the
cabin. Aunt Claudia said she hoped we would sink;
she would give all she possessed to be still one moment
on the bottom of the ocean. And while she was
helpless I staid on deck and advised the ship’s captain.
He said he had <i>heard</i> of mermaids, but I was the first
he had ever <i>seen</i>! Oh, he was very gallant, was the
sea-captain, and made me a fine lot of compliments.
And did I expect to be cooped up in Fort Prince
George, as if it were in blockade!”</p>

<p>Captain Howard rather winced at the word, and
thought ruefully of the lack of corn, and the coming of
his marching orders.</p>

<p>“I expected to ride, papa. I thought you might
lend me a mount some day—”</p>

<p>“Permit me to offer you a horse of mine that might
carry a lady fairly well—” Raymond began, for
among his few possessions he owned several choice
animals which he had bought very young from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Indians. The Cherokees boasted at that day some
exceedingly fine horses, supposed to be descendants
of the Spanish barbs of De Soto’s expedition through
that region. Raymond was an excellent judge and
had selected young creatures at a low valuation at one
of the sales when the Indians had driven down a herd
to barter with the ranchmen of the pastoral country
further to the south. His cheek flushed, his eye
flashed with a sudden accession of joyful anticipation—but
Captain Howard shook his head. He was not
so secure in the peace of the frontier as he had earlier
been. Certain incidents of the expedition to Little
Tamotlee were not reassuring. He would hardly
have trusted his daughter out for a canter along the
smooth reaches of the “trading-path,” as the road
was called that passed Fort Prince George to the upper
country, or the trail the soldiers made in the forest
for fuel supplies, even could he have detailed half
the garrison as her escort. Only the guns of Fort
Prince George he now considered adequate protection—not
because of their special efficiency, but
solely because of the terrors of artillery which the
Indians felt, and could never overcome.</p>

<p>“Why, papa—when I have ridden cross-country
to hounds, and twice in Scotland I was in at the
death! Papa—<i>why, papa</i>! are you afraid I would
fall off the pony?” she demanded, with such a glance
of deprecation and mortified pride that it was hard
for her father not to express the true reason for his
withheld consent. But as commandant of the garrison
he could not acquaint the two soldiers who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
rowed the boat, and through them the rest of the force,
with his fears for the permanence of the peace on
the frontier, and his doubts as to their speedy departure.
Now that the period of their exile had been
placed, and that they were in sight of home, as it
were, they could hardly wait a day longer, and trained
and tried and true as they were, he might well have
feared a mutiny, had an inopportune suggestion of
delay or doubt grown rife amongst them. He hesitated
and cleared his throat, and seemed about to
speak, then turned and glanced over his shoulder at
Keowee Town, still lying apparently asleep. If the
approach of the boat had been noted, the municipality
gave no sign, whether from some queer savage reason,
or disfavor to the visitors, or simply a freak of affectation,
he did not care to think. He was acutely
conscious of the face dearest to him in the world,
downcast, deprecating, and flushed, appealing to him
when he could not speak.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know you are a monstrous fine horsewoman—”
he began extravagantly, “but there is no
road.”</p>

<p>“And now I know you are laughing at me, papa,”
she said, with dignity, “and I thought you were proud
of my riding so well,”—with a little plangent inflection
of reproach. “But I left the whole field behind
in Scotland—I <i>was</i> in at the death, twice—I
<i>can</i> ride”—with stalwart self-assertion. “And I
can shoot—I won the silver arrow at the last archery
meet at home!”</p>

<p>“There can surely be no objection to archery, sir,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Raymond glanced at the captain, aware in some sort
of the nature of his difficulty, and seeking to smooth
his way.</p>

<p>“No—no—” said Captain Howard, heartily,—then
with a sudden doubt—“except a bow and arrows
of a proper size; but I can have these made for you
at once—if the Indians are not too lazy, or too sullen,
or too disaffected to make them. I will see if
I can order a proper weapon at Keowee.”</p>

<p>“I have the very thing,” exclaimed Raymond,
delightedly, “if Miss Howard will do me the honor
to accept it. When we were at Tuckaleechee last
year, Captain,” he said, turning to the commandant,
“I secured, for a curiosity, a bow and quiver of arrows
which had been made for the Indian king’s nephew,
who had died before they were finished. Otherwise
they would have been buried with him, according to
Cherokee etiquette. They are as fine as the Indians
can make them, for he was the heir to the throne,
following the female line. You know, Miss Howard,
here among the Cherokee chiefs the nephew has the
right of succession, not the son. This boy was twelve
or fourteen years old, and the weapons are of corresponding
weight.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing,” said Captain Howard, cordially,—then
with an afterthought,—“but this deprives
you of a handsome curiosity, ornamented for royalty.
You may <i>borrow</i> it, Arabella.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’d love to <i>own</i> it,” cried Miss Howard,
joyously, with a charming frankness that made the
color deepen in Raymond’s cheek. “I’ll carry it home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and shoot with it at the next archery meet. I hope
it is very barbaric and splendid in its decorations,
Mr. Raymond.”</p>

<p>“I think it will not disappoint you,” replied Raymond,
in a glow of enthusiasm, for it was a choice
bit of aboriginal art; the Indians often spent years
of labor on the ornamentation of a single weapon.
“It carries all the gewgaws that it can without impairing
the elasticity of the wood, but the quiver is
more gorgeous; the arrows are winged with flamingo
feathers, and tipped with crystal quartz.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” began Arabella—</p>

<p>But her father’s admonitions broke in upon her
delight. “Those arrows are deadly,” he exclaimed,
“as hard as steel. And you must be careful how you
place your target; you might shoot some animal, or
a soldier; you must be careful.”</p>

<p>“What a forlorn fate for a soldier—to die by a
lady’s hand!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Ladies usually shoot by proxy,” Raymond said,
with a conscious laugh, “and first and last they have
done woful execution among soldiers.”</p>

<p>“They never shoot by proxy at our club,” declared
Arabella, densely.</p>

<p>“That’s mighty good of them,” said her father,
laughing a little, as he turned to look at the shore.
He ordered the oarsmen to pull in, despite the
fact that no signs of life were yet visible about the
town.</p>

<p>When, however, the keel grazed the gravelly bank
and Captain Howard and his quarter-master and fort-adjutant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
stepped on shore, there appeared as suddenly
as if he had risen from the ground the “second
man” of Keowee Town, attended by three or four of
inferior rank, a trifle sullen, very silent, and when he
spoke at last, after he had led the way to the municipal
booth, or cabin, he was full of ungracious excuses
for the non-appearance of the chief to greet the
English Capteny. He had thought the boat held only
the quarter-master, the fort’s “second man”—“Confound
his impudence!” interpolated that officer, an
observation which the discreet interpreter did not
see fit to repeat,—the fort’s “second man,” come to
beg for corn. The British, he continued, were pleased
to call the Indians beggars, but no mendicant that
he had ever heard whine could whine as the fort’s
“second man” whined when he begged for corn.</p>

<p>It was well for the fort’s “second man” that he
was already seated on a buffalo rug on the ground,
his legs doubled up, tailor-wise, in front of him, or
he might have fallen to the earth in his sputtering
indignation. His rubicund, round face grew scarlet.
Portly as he was already he seemed puffed up with
rage, and his features visibly swelled as he retorted.—Had
he not offered the Frog to pay the town in
golden guineas for the corn—he had not begged; he
had asked to purchase.</p>

<p>Walasi, the Frog, shook his head. Of what good
were English guineas to people who had no corn.
Corn was more precious than gold—could he plant
those golden guineas of the fort’s “second man,” and
make corn? Could horses eat guineas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“No,” said the fort’s “second man,” “but asses
could, and did.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the Keowee “second man” said the
fort’s “second man” spake in riddles, and relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>Thus brought to a dead-lock the quarter-master
looked appealingly at the commandant, who, albeit
sensible of the discourtesy offered him by the non-appearance
of the chief, and his derogation of dignity
in conferring with a “second man,” came to his subordinate’s
relief.</p>

<p>The British officer did not wish to inconvenience
the town of Keowee in any manner, he said, and regretted
much that their visits were not welcome.
Whereupon the Frog showed visible uneasiness, for
with the Cherokees hospitality was the very first and
foremost virtue, and for it to be impugned was a
reflection upon the town. He hastened to say
volubly that the beloved Capteny was much mistaken;
the chief’s heart was wrung not to take him by his
noble hand. But they had feared—they much deprecated
that the British Capteny had come, too, to
<i>beg</i>—to beg for corn; and it would wrench the very
soul of the chief of Keowee to refuse him aught.</p>

<p>“The chief is fortunate to be so well furnished with
gold as to throw it away,” said Captain Howard.</p>

<p>That the Frog had learned somewhat in his intercourse
with the commercial French who, with covert
strategy, had plied a brisk trade with the Indians
despite their treaty with the British, was evidenced
in the shrug with which he declared he could not say.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
The Indian wanted little—he wanted his own corn—that
was all. It belonged to him—he asked for
no man’s gold.</p>

<p>Captain Howard was at a loss. The military resource
of the seizing of supplies was impracticable
since the treaty of peace. The British government
owned merely the ground on which Fort Loudon and
Fort Prince George stood, and a right of way to those
works. Moreover, with his small force the measure
was impossible. Therefore it was indeed necessary
to beg for corn at six—nay, ten prices, in English
gold. He sat for a few moments, gazing absently
at the prospect, the austere wintry mountains under
the gray sky, the illimitable, leafless wilderness, the
shining line of the river that caught and focussed such
chill light as the day vouchsafed, the bastions and
flying flag of Fort Prince George on the opposite
bank, and close in to the hither side the brilliant fleck
of color that the scarlet coats of the oarsmen and
Ensign Raymond gave to the scene, as sombre, otherwise,
as a sketch in sepia. He noted that the rowers
had thrust out from the shore five or six oars’ length,
perhaps, and that they now and again gently dipped
their oars to keep the craft at a fixed distance and
obviate drifting with the current. The people of
Keowee Town were not altogether proof against
curiosity. From the vantage ground of the second
men’s cabin Captain Howard could see stealthy
figures, chiefly of women and children, peering out
from doors or skulking behind bushes, all eyes directed
toward the shallop rocking in a steely gleam of light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
aslant upon a steely ripple of water, the only vivid
chromatic tone in the neutral tinted scene.</p>

<p>There is a certain temperament which is incapable
of sustaining success. It may cope with difficulty
or it may endure disaster. But a degree of prosperity
destroys its values, annuls good judgment, and
distorts the perspective of all the world in the range
of vision. The British Captain was at his wits’ end.
He had no corn, and if none were to be bought he
could get no corn. Few people have shared the
Frog’s pleasure of seeing their victorious enemies
the victims of so insoluble a problem. The declination
of the chief of Keowee to receive the magnate
from across the river was in itself a blow to pride, an
insult, a flout, as contemptuous as might be devised.
But as a matter of policy it was an error. If it had
been a question of crops, a démêlé with a neighboring
town, a matter of boundary, the selection of
timbers for building purposes, no man could have
acted with finer judgment than Walasi, the Frog.
But he was a Cherokee and he hated the
British Capteny with rancor. He must twist the
knife in the wound, already gaping wide with
anguish for the famishing stock. He assumed an air
of reproach, and knowing even as he spoke that he
transcended politic monitions, he stipulated that it
was but the accident of the Capteny’s absence at
Tamotlee which had precipitated disaster. When
the Indians at Keowee had beheld the flames of the
granary they had rushed to the assistance of their
neighbors, the soldiers. Many hands do much work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
But the great gates were closed against them, and
when the Cherokees approached, he declared, the
cannon were fired upon them from the fort, and
many great balls rolled along, and popped hissing hot
into the river. And it was only on account of the
defective aim of the garrison that any were now left
alive. And their hearts had become very poor because
of their despised friendship. But cannon there
were in the Cherokee nation!—and, he boasted,
some day the garrison of Fort Prince George would
hear, and shake with fear to hear, the loud whooping
from out their throats, and the deep rumble of their
howls; and would see, and be dazzled with terror to
see, the fire come whizzing out of their muzzles
with red-hot balls—but—but—</p>

<p>Walasi, the Frog, suddenly became aware that it
was a very intent and steadfast gaze in the commandant’s
eyes, as he sat and listened, spell-bound. And
he, Walasi, who dealt only with crops, and houses,
and town politics, who had never been either warrior
or councillor, was conscious that he had gone too far
in a position of trust beyond his deserts, and above
his condition. The insult to Captain Howard in
setting a second man to confer with him had developed
a double-edged sharpness.</p>

<p>“But—but,” the Frog continued, “the good Capteny
whom all loved would not be among them.
None wished to harm the beloved Capteny.”</p>

<p>He paused again, staring in anxiety, for the intent
look on the good Capteny’s face had vanished. He
was shaking his head in melancholy negation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“No, my good Walasi, no one here loves the
Capteny. I am gone to visit my friend, the chief
of Tamotlee, and my mad young men burn my granary
and fool with my cannon—you have cannon, you
say? But no,—I cannot stop to talk of cannon!
I think of corn—corn—corn! And for gold you
will let me have no corn. And the chief of Keowee
will not see me!”</p>

<p>The eye-lashes of Walasi, the Frog, rose and fell
so fast that he seemed blinking for some moments.
He had said too much, but to obliterate the recollection
in the British Capteny’s mind it might be well
to interest him anew in corn—to keep him anxious
and returning; he would not then have time or inclination
to recur to the question of cannon—the
unwary Frog felt that he had indeed said too much—but
he was only a “second man,” and should not be
set to deal with a capteny of the British.</p>

<p>The policy of sharing their corn had been doubted
by the head-men. But he would take the responsibility
to send—say a laden pettiaugre.</p>

<p>“Damme, Walasi! <i>one</i> pettiaugre!” cried Captain
Howard, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“For to-day—another time, perhaps. But the
heart of Keowee is very poor to deny the British
Capteny, whom it loves like a brother, <i>one</i> pettiaugre.”</p>

<p>There was a great telling out and chinking of gold
in the second man’s sanctum, and presently a
dozen stalwart tribesmen were carrying the corn in
large baskets to the pettiaugre, coming and going
in endless procession in this slow method of loading.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
Captain Howard, resolutely mustering his patience,
watched the last bushel aboard that the pettiaugre
would hold—the craft, indeed, was settling in the
water when he signed to the Indian boatmen to pole
it across. Then he took a ceremonious, almost affectionate
leave of Walasi, and walked down to the
water’s edge with so absorbed and thoughtful a mien
that he hardly looked up when his daughter called out
to him from the canoe, which was rapidly rowing in
to take him aboard; as he stepped over the gunwale
and caught her eye he had a dazed look as if just
awakened from a revery, or some deep and careful
calculation, and he said, bluntly,—“Bless my soul,
child, I had forgotten you were here!”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> with whom life deals liberally are often less
grateful than exacting. Any failure of the largess
of fate is like withheld deserts or a wanton injury.
It is as if they had an inalienable right to expect
better usage. It never seems to occur to these favorites
of fortune that others have as fair a claim upon
the munificence of circumstance, and that but for a
cloaked mystery of dispensation they would share
equally with their fellows. Thus a disconcerting
chance or a temporary obstacle rouses no disposition
to measure strength with adversity, or to cope with
untoward combinations, but an angry amazement,
an indignant displeasure, a sense of trespass upon one’s
lawful domain of success and happiness that result in
blundering egotistic self-assertion, which often fails
in the clearance of the obstruction to the paths of
bland and self-satisfied progress.</p>

<p>Mervyn, chancing to glance down from the block-house
tower whither he had repaired shortly before
sunset on his rounds, to see that the sentinels were
properly posted and that they had the countersign
correctly, was not only dismayed but affronted to
perceive walking briskly up the slope from the river-bank
Captain Howard, the quarter-master, the fort-adjutant,
and following them at a leisurely pace Ensign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
Raymond, with Miss Howard on his arm. They were
conversing earnestly; her face was full of interest as he
spoke. Now and then she glanced up at him, as if
with a question; the glow of the west rested in a transfiguring
halo about her head, her golden hair showing
beneath the dark green calash. In the setting of
the bleak, cold day her face was as illumined as a
saint’s. A band of dull red was about the horizon
above the sombre wooded mountains, promising
fairer skies for the morrow, and now and then,
through some translucence of the clouds a chill white
sheen spread over the landscape less like sunlight than
moonbeams. Still gazing at the two Mervyn marked
that Arabella noted this aspect, and called her
companion’s attention to the abnormal quality of its
glister.</p>

<p>“That is like ‘the sleeping sun,’” she said. “How
quaint is that idea of the Indians—how poetic,
that the moon is but the sun asleep!”</p>

<p>“This, though, is ‘the sun awake in the day.’
<i>Nu-da-ige-hi!</i>” he explained.</p>

<p>She repeated the phrase after him. “And ‘the
sleeping sun’?”</p>

<p>“<i>Nu-da-su-na-ye-hi</i>,” he replied.</p>

<p>She paused to repeat both phrases anew, smiling
like a docile child, learning a lesson.</p>

<p>At the distance, of course, Mervyn could not hear the
words, but the responsive smiles, the obvious mutual
interest, the graceful attitudes of the two as she once
more took Raymond’s arm and they walked slowly
on toward the gate—each phase of the scene was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
charged with a signal irritation to his pride, his nerves,
his intense self-consciousness. He was angry with
her; why should she seek solace for his absence in
jaunting abroad? He was angry with her father for
granting her this opportunity. He could not imagine
why her aunt had not been more insistent in duty—he
would have thought it well that she should
be penned up in the commandant’s parlor sewing her
sampler until such time as it was practicable for
him to rejoice the dulness by his endless talk of himself—which,
indeed, those who loved him would
find no burden. He was angry more than all and beyond
expression with Raymond, who profited by his
enforced absence, and whom he had feared from the
beginning as a rival. He knew well the character
of the comments of the mess upon his course in pushing
the immaterial omission in the matter of the
guard report to an extreme limit, and his own reticence
afterward concerning his absence from the
scene of the fire till it was no longer possible to conceal
the circumstance. Captain Howard, himself, had
opened his stubborn, reluctant eyes to the repute
among his brother officers that this had inflicted upon
him. He feared Raymond would acquaint Arabella
with their estimate of his part in the incident. He
was wild when he thought of the duration of his tour
of duty. Till to-morrow he was caught fast, laid by
the heels, held to all the observances of the regulations
as strictly as if the little frontier mud fort were a
fortress of value, garrisoned by thousands of troops.
He knew, nevertheless, the special utility of routine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
here, where the garrison was so weak,—scant a
hundred men. The enemy—conquered, indeed, but
only by the extraneous aid of a special expeditionary
force—was still strong and rancorous, able to throw
two thousand warriors against the ramparts in a few
hours, but he argued it was farcical to detail the officers
to this frequent recurrent duty, albeit appropriate to
their rank, when sergeants, corporals, even intelligent
privates might be trusted in their stead.</p>

<p>He had been a good soldier, and ordinarily his
pulse would have quickened to the partial solution of
the feed problem, evidenced shortly by the issuance
of the quarter-master’s contingent to the unloading
of the pettiaugre at the river-bank. The stable men
were riding down the horses, harnessed to slides in
default of wagons, to bring in the provender; some
of them carried great baskets like those of the Indians,
but disposed upon the beasts pannier-wise. The
loud, gay voices made the dull still dusk ring again.
Raymond avoided the great gate whence now and
then a horseman, thus cumbrously accoutred, issued
as suddenly as if flung from a catapult and went
clattering boisterously down to the river-bank.
An abrupt encounter under the arch with these plunging
wights might not discommode Captain Howard
and the quarter-master, but with his fair charge
Raymond sought the quieter precincts of the sally-port.
There he was detained for the lack of the countersign,
and while the sentinel called the corporal the
two young people stood, apparently quite content,
still softly talking, now and then a rising inflection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
of their suave tones coming to Mervyn’s ear as he
lingered in the block-house tower and watched them.
They were taking their way presently across the parade
to the commandant’s quarters, and as Mervyn’s eyes
followed them thither, he perceived the face of Mrs.
Annandale at the window. She looked as Mervyn
felt, and as he noted it he winced from the idea that
perhaps the chaperon cared for him only for his
worldly advantages. He had no mind to be married
for these values, he said to himself, indignantly.
Then he had a candid monition that he was not in
great danger of being married at all—whatever Mrs.
Annandale’s convictions might be, the young lady had
stipulated that nothing was to be considered settled
till she knew her own mind—she was yet, she had
protested, so little acquainted with him. He had one
natural humble impulse, like a lover, to hope that
she might never know him better to like him less.
The thought cleared the atmosphere of storm. Mrs.
Annandale naturally preferred him—why should
she not?—and if she had wished to stimulate his
devotion she would have set up Raymond, and encouraged
him as a rival. He could not imagine that
she considered Raymond too formidable for a fictitious
lover. A fascinating semblance might merge
into a stubborn fact.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale met the two excursionists at the
door with a most severe countenance of disfavor.</p>

<p>“And where have you been junketing, Miss?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>“I have been finding corn for the garrison,” Arabella<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
replied, demurely. “I have brought in a whole
pettiaugre load.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale lifted her gaze to the animated
aspect of the parade. A fog hung low, but through it
was heard the continual tramp of hoofs, and now and
again a laden animal passed swiftly, more than one
sending forth shrill neighs of content, obviously
aware of the value of this replenishment of the larder
and recognizing it as for their own provision. Across
the parade and beyond the barracks in the stable
precincts lights were flickering and lanterns swaying.
One of the large sheds was to serve as granary, and
the sound of hammers and nails gave token of some
belated arrangements there for the provender.</p>

<p>“And did you think I should be satisfied with that
bit of a message that your father sent me through the
sentinel at the gate—that he had taken you with
him amongst the Indians! Sure, I have had fits on
fits!”</p>

<p>“’Twas but to keep in practice, Aunt Claudia,”
Arabella retorted. “Sure, you could not be afraid
that papa is not able to take care of me!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale, in doleful eclipse, looked sourly
at Raymond.</p>

<p>“With this gentleman’s worshipful assistance,” she
snapped.</p>

<p>“I am always at her service—and at yours,
madam,” said Raymond. He bowed profoundly, his
cocked hat in his hand almost swept the ground.
Mervyn still watching, though the dusk strained
his eyes, had little reason to grudge his rival the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
colloquy that looked so pretty and gracious at the
distance.</p>

<p>He contrived to meet Raymond that night in the
mess-hall. The dinner was concluded; the place
almost deserted, the quarter-master being at the improvised
granary, and Jerrold and Innis both on extra
duty, the ensign having charge of the pettiaugre still
lying half unloaded at the bank, and the lieutenant
keeping a cautious surveillance on the parties sent
out and their return with the precious commodity.</p>

<p>Raymond had taken down a bow and gayly
decorated quiver from the wall, and was examining
them critically by the light of the candles on the
table. There was a glow of satisfaction on his face
and the bright radiance of gratulation in his eyes,
for the weapons designed for a royal hand were even
more beautiful, and curious, and rare than he had
thought; the bow, elastic and strong, wrought to the
smoothness of satin, the wood showing an exquisite
veining, tipped at each end with polished and glittering
quartz, the arrows similarly finished, and winged
with scarlet flamingo feathers, the quiver a mass of
bead embroideries with dyed porcupine quills and
scarlet fringes.</p>

<p>Mervyn stared at him silently for a time, thinking
this earnest surveillance might attract his attention
and induce him to speak first. But Raymond,
thoughtfully murmuring, <i>sotto voce</i>,—“‘Tell me,
maidens, have you seen,’” took no notice of his
quondam Damon, save a nod of greeting when Mervyn
had entered and sat down on the opposite side of the
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“What are you going to do with those things?”
Mervyn asked. No one can be so brusque as the
thoroughly trained. A few weeks ago, however, the
question would have savored merely of familiarity,
as of boys together. Now, in view of the strained
relations subsisting between them, it was so rude as
to justify the reply. Raymond lifted his head, stared
hard at his brother officer across the table, then
answered:—</p>

<p>“What do you suppose?”</p>

<p>Mervyn put his elbow on the table, with his chin in
his hand, speaking between his set teeth.</p>

<p>“I will tell you exactly what I suppose. I suppose
you are insufferable enough to intend to present them
to Miss Howard.”</p>

<p>Raymond was obliged to lean backward to be rid
of the intervening flame of the candle in order to see
his interlocutor, face to face, and the action gave
added emphasis to the answer,—“Why, bless me,
you are a conjurer!”</p>

<p>“I want you to understand distinctly that I object.”</p>

<p>“I shall not take the trouble to understand any
objection of yours,” declared Raymond.</p>

<p>“I have a right to object to your presumption in
offering her any gift. She is engaged to be married
to me.”</p>

<p>Raymond paled visibly. Then with a sudden
return of color he declared, hardily:—</p>

<p>“I should send them to her even if she were
already married to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“You are insolent and presuming, sir. I object.
I forbid it. It will be very unpleasant to her to refuse
them.”</p>

<p>“I should suppose so,” cried Raymond, airily, “since
she has already accepted them—this afternoon, in
her father’s presence.”</p>

<p>Mervyn sat dumbfounded. He had not dreamed
that she would continue to exercise such free agency
as to act in a matter like this without a reference to
his wish. And her father—while the distinctions of
rank in the army did not hold good in outside society
or even in the fraternal association of the mess-room,
he could not easily upbraid the commandant of the
fort, in years so much his senior, for a failure in
his paternal duty, an oblivion of etiquette, of his
obligations to his daughter’s fiancé and undue encouragement
of a possible rival. But why had
Captain Howard not given her a caution to refer the
matter to his, Mervyn’s, preference,—why had he
permitted the offer and the acceptance of the gift in
his presence. To be sure the weapons were but
curios, and of only nominal cost in this region, but to
receive anything from Raymond! And then the pitfall
into which Mervyn had so resolutely cast himself—how
could Raymond do aught but send the gift
which the lady had so willingly, so graciously accepted.
Raymond’s eyes were glancing full of laughter at his
sedate objection, his lordly prohibition. The things
were already hers!</p>

<p>Not a syllable of speech suggested itself to Mervyn’s
lips; not a plan of retraction, or withdrawal from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
the room. He felt an intense relief when Jerrold and
Innis came plunging into the hall, full of satisfaction
for the accomplishment of the proper bestowal of
the corn in the makeshift granary, and their computations
of the length of time the quantity secured
might by economy be made to last.</p>

<p>“What beauties,” said Jerrold, noticing the weapons.
“You got these in Tuckaleechee last year, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“And I have presented them to Miss Howard,”
said Raymond.</p>

<p>“Good! Just the right weight, I should judge.
Does she shoot?”</p>

<p>Mervyn sat boiling with rage as he heard Raymond
interrogated and answering, from the vantage ground
of familiar friendship, these details, all unknown to
him, concerning his fiancée.</p>

<p>“Won the silver arrow recently at an archery competition,
she tells me.”</p>

<p>“Gad! I’d like to see her draw this thing!” And
Jerrold pulled the taut line of deer-sinews, noting
admiringly the elasticity of the wood as the bow bent
and he fitted an arrow in place.</p>

<p>He laid it aside, presently, and turned to the
table. “And what is this?” he asked, picking up
a bag of bead embroidery, rich and ornate, with long
bead fringes, and a stiff bead-wrought handle, like
a bail.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s for Mrs. Annandale—I think it must
be intended for a tobacco pouch, but it occurred to
me she might use it for a knotting-bag, and as a
souvenir of the country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Mervyn silently cursed himself for a fool. Possibly
Raymond had naught in mind other than the
ordinary civil attentions incumbent in such a situation.
He was merely making his compliments to
the two ladies, members of the commandant’s family,
visiting the post under circumstances so unusual.
Jerrold evidently thought the selection and presentation
of the curios very felicitous, and was obviously
racking his brains to devise some equally pretty
method of expressing his pleasure and interest in their
presence here.</p>

<p>Even the acute Mrs. Annandale viewed the incident
in much the same light. The simultaneous appearance
of the bow and quiver with the gorgeous little
“knotting-bag” seemed only well-devised compliments
to the ladies,—guests in the fort,—and she
thought it very civil of Mr. Raymond, and said she was
glad to have something worth while to take back
to Kent to prove she had ever been to America,—she
apparently did not rely on her own word.</p>

<p>In truth it was not every day that such things could
be picked up here. The Cherokees were growing dull
and disheartened. The cheap, tawdry European
trifles with which the Indian trade had flooded the
country had served to disparage in their estimation
their own laborious ornaments and articles of use.
When a pipe or a bowl of a kind turned out by millions
in a mould, strange and new to their perverted
taste, could be bought in an instant of barter, why
should they expend two years in the slow cutting of a
pipe of moss agate, by the method of friction, rubbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
one stone on another; when a bushel of glass beads
was to be had for a trifle how should they care to
drill holes through tiny cylinders of shell, with a
polish that bespoke a lifetime of labor? There could
be blankets bought at the traders in lieu of fur robes
and braided mantles. Now-a-days, except grease,
and paint, and British muskets,—the barrels sawed
off as the Indians liked them,—there was little to
choose for souvenirs in the Cherokee country.</p>

<p>Arabella was unaccountably disappointed. Not in
the weapons, themselves—she cried out in delighted
pleasure and astonishment on beholding them. Then,
certainly, she did not grudge Mrs. Annandale the
trophy of her knotting-bag. But she had felt that he
had not intended the present as a mere bit of gallantry,
a passing compliment. She had valued the gift because
of its thoughtfulness for her pleasure; he had
noted the need it filled; it contributed to her entertainment;
it came as a personal token from him to
her. But now since it was relegated to the category
of a compliment to the ladies, along with the knotting-bag
which was already blazing in considerable splendor
at Mrs. Annandale’s side, and lighting up her
black satin gown with a very pretty effect, Arabella
felt as if she had lost something. A light that the
skies had not bestowed on that dark landscape was
dying out of the recollection of the day on the river,—she
remembered it as it was, with its dull sad
monotone of the hills, the gray sky, the cold rippled
steel of the waters, and the cutting blasts of the wind.
She had returned home all aglow, and now she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
cold, and tired, and dispirited; and she wondered that
Raymond did not come to play “Whisk” or Quadrille
if he desired to make a general compliment to
the ladies—and why her father had grown to be
such dull company.</p>

<p>For Captain Howard did naught but sit after dinner
in his great chair, with his decanter on the table
beside him, and his glass of wine untouched in his
hand, and stare at the flaming logs in deep revery,
agreeing with a nod or an irrelevant word to all his
sister might say while she detailed practically the
whole history of the county of Kent, not merely since
his departure thence, but since indeed it was erected.</p>

<p>Captain Howard, tall, bony, muscular, stout of
heart, rude of experience, seemed hardly a man to
see visions, but he beheld in the flames of the fire
that evening things that were not there.</p>

<p>Cannon in the Cherokee country! How they volleyed
and smoked from between the logs of the commandant’s
fire. Here and there in the brilliant dancing
jets he beheld a score of war bonnets. He could
see quick figures circle, leap, and turn again in the lithe
writhings of the protean shadow and blaze. The
piles of red-hot coals between the fire-dogs were a
similitude of the boulders, the cliffs, the rocky fastnesses
of those almost inaccessible wilds. Above a
swirling current of blazes bursting forth from a great
hickory log he beheld a battery planted on a commanding
promontory, harassing with its scintillating
explosions, the shadowy craft that sought to escape
on the turbulent stream below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>Cannon in the Cherokee country!</p>

<p>Naught could so extend the power of the Indians.
Always they had longed for artillery. How many
times had the crafty delegations sought to represent
to him that “one little piece” would do much to
strengthen them against the advance of the perfidious
French,—whom, in truth, they loved, and they
rallied continually to the standard of the “great
French father.” But even though the French were in
their aggressions successful beyond all precedent in
detaching the Cherokees from their compact with
Great Britain, and setting them in arms against the
government, they never dared to trust the tribe with
cannon. So easily is a swivel gun turned, and with
the fickle Indians it might be against the foe to-day
and the friend to-morrow. With the comparative
long range of the arm of that time, a few pieces, well
placed in commanding situations, might hold the
defiles of the Great Smoky Mountains against all
comers.</p>

<p>Cannon in the Cherokee country!</p>

<p>How could Walasi’s words be true! Captain Howard
meditated on the difficulty of their transportation
amidst the stupendous upheavals that made up
the face of the country,—the steep slopes, the tremendous
heights, the cuplike valleys, hardly a plot of
twenty acres of level ground in the whole vast region.
For his own part in expectation of the evacuation of
Fort Prince George he was thankful that the currents
of the Keowee and the broad Savannah would
serve to bear its armament to the forts in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
lower country. He continued to canvass this theme
with a soldier’s interest in a problem of transportation.
To the civilian the glories and honors of war
are won or lost on the fenced field of battle, but to the
military expert the secret of victory or defeat is often
discovered in the mobilization of the force. He was
returning with unappeased wonder to the problem,—and
to this day it is a matter of conjecture,—how
the twelve cannon of Fort Loudon, more than one
hundred miles to the northwest, had ever been conveyed
to that remote inaccessible post. The blockade
of the fort, its capitulation, and the massacre of
its starveling garrison were events that befell before
his detail to Fort Prince George, and much of mystery
still environed the catastrophe. He knew that after
the Cherokees were punished, and subdued, and
practically disarmed by the British force sent into the
country to reduce them to submission, the treaty of
peace provided for the return of the cannon which the
Indians had seized. They brought them as far as
they could on the Tennessee River, then with infinite
labor dragged them through the wilderness, an incredible
portage, to the Keowee. Suddenly Captain
Howard sprang to his feet; his glass of rich old port,
falling from his hand and shivering into a thousand
fragments on the hearth, sent up a vinous white flame
from the coals that received the libation.</p>

<p>For the Indians had brought eight guns only!
One piece was known to have burst, overcharged and
mishandled by the Cherokees in their experiments in
gunnery after the reduction of the fort. The others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
it was declared, had been spiked, or otherwise demolished,
by the defenders, in violation of the terms
of their capitulation—it was claimed that they had
sunk each piece as they could in the river. The fact
which had been established that they had hidden large
stores of powder, in the hope and expectation that
the government might soon again reoccupy the works,
was not consistent with this story of the destruction
of the guns and might serve in a degree to discredit
the statement of the Indians that all the cannon they
had captured were delivered to the British authorities.
And now this boast of cannon in the Cherokee
country! He well believed it! He would have taken
his oath that there were three pieces—all part of
the armament of the ill-fated Fort Loudon, withheld
by the Cherokees, awaiting an opportunity and
the long-delayed day of vengeance for the slaughter
and the conflagrations that marked the track of the
British forays through their devastated land, when
for lack of powder they could oppose no effective
resistance, and were fain to submit to the bullet, the
knife, the torch, till the conquerors were tired out
with their orgies of blood and fire.</p>

<p>He became suddenly conscious of his daughter’s
hazel eyes, wide and lustrous with amazement, lifted
to his, as he stood, alert, triumphant, tingling with
excitement, on the hearth, and heard in mingled embarrassment
and laughter his sister’s sarcastic recommendation
that he should throw the decanter into the
fire after his bumper of port wine.</p>

<p>“Upon my word you frontier fanfarons are mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
lavish. In England we picture you as going sadly
all the day wrapped in a greasy blanket, eating Indian
meal, and drinking ‘fire-water,’—and we come here
to find you all lace ruffles, and powdered wigs, and
prancing in your silk hose, and throwing your port
wine into the fire to see it blaze!”</p>

<p>“The goblet slipped from my hand—it was a mischance,
Sister.”</p>

<p>“My certie! it shows you’ve had too much already;
’twas ever the fault of a soldier. Had I my way
in the old times you should have been none.”</p>

<p>“I would seem more temperate under a table,
after a meet, like one of your home-staying, fox-hunting
squires,” suggested the captain.</p>

<p>“Well, but ’tis a pity a man should have no resource
but the army. Faith, I’m glad George Mervyn
is not to be forever marching and counter-marching.”</p>

<p>She glanced slyly at Arabella, who looked pale in
faint blue and a little dull. She did not respond, and
Mrs. Annandale had a transient fear that she might
say she did not care how George Mervyn spent his
future. The girl’s mind, like her father’s, was elsewhere,
but with what different subjects of contemplation!
Captain Howard was saying to himself that
he could never leave the Cherokee country with
British cannon in the hands of the Indians. Even
without this menace the evacuation of Fort Prince
George seemed a trifle premature, in view of their
inimical temper. How far this was fostered by
the expectation of securing an adequate supply of
powder to utilize the guns to the destruction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
British defences, which could not stand for an hour
against a well-directed fire of artillery, and the massacre
of the garrison, none could say. The French, now
retiring from the country on every hand, might, as
a Parthian dart, supply the Indians’ need of powder,
and then indeed the Cherokee War would be to fight
anew,—with much disaster to the infant settlements
of the provinces to the southward, for the stalwart
pioneers were hardily pushing into the region below,
their “cow-pens,” or ranches along the watercourses,
becoming oases of a rude civilization, and their vast
herds roaming the savannas in lordly promise of
bucolic wealth.</p>

<p>Cannon in the Cherokee country!</p>

<p>Captain Howard could but laugh, even in his perplexity,
when he thought of the resilient execution of
the insult offered him by the chief of Keowee Town
in declining to receive the military mendicant and
setting a “second man,” Walasi, the Frog, a commercial
man, so to speak, to deal with the soldier.</p>

<p>“Tell us the joke,” said his sister, insistently, with
no inclination to be shut out of mind when she was
aware it was closed against her.</p>

<p>“Only reflecting on the events of the day,” he said
evasively, and Arabella, brightening suddenly, declared
with a gurgling laugh, “Yes, we had a fine
time on the river.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> an anxious perplexity had harassed Captain
Howard’s repose in the night watches during his
tour of duty at Fort Prince George. Never one like
this, he thought. Try as he might, the problem seemed
to have no possible solution. Every plan bristled
with difficulties. Every chance seemed arrayed
against his eager hopes. The British cannon were in
the Cherokee country, withheld, in defiance of the
terms of the treaty, capable of incalculable harm both
to the garrison as matters now stood, and to the frontier
settlements in the future. The moral effect of supinely
permitting the Indians to overreach and outwit
the government was in itself of disastrous possibilities,
reinstating their self-confidence, renewing their <i>esprit
de corps</i>, and fostering that contempt for the capacities
of their enemy, from which the Cherokees always
suffered as well as inflicted so many futile calamities.
The cannon must be surrendered in accordance with
the terms of the treaty, or he would be obliged
to call down the retributive wrath of the British
War Office upon the recalcitrant and perfidious
Cherokee nation. But while with his handful of
troops he awaited British aid,—an expeditionary
force sent out to compel compliance with the treaty
and to discipline the Indians,—he must needs expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
to sustain the preliminary violence of such wars.
Fort Prince George might well be razed to the ground
by the very cannon in contention, the settlers to the
southward would certainly be massacred as of old,
and all the dearly-bought fruits of the late terrible
conflict would be lost and brought to naught. If it
were only possible to secure the cannon without an
appeal to the government, without jeopardizing the
peace of the frontier!</p>

<p>Captain Howard held himself no great tactician, but
when he rose in the morning from a sleepless pillow
he believed he had formulated a scheme to compass
these ends which might possibly stand the strain of
execution. True, it had its special and great dangers,
against which he would provide as far as he was able,
but he feared nevertheless it would cost some lives.
And then a new and troublous doubt rose in his
mind. It would not be consonant with his duty
to again absent himself from Fort Prince George at
this crisis. He must needs delegate the active execution
of his scheme, and somehow the material on
which he could depend impressed him as strangely
unavailable when it came to such a test. Mervyn,
by virtue of his rank, might seem best fitted for
the enterprise, and he had been considered a steady
and capable officer. The matter was extra hazardous.
It necessitated a clear judgment, an absolute obedience
to orders if possible, great physical endurance,
and a cool head. In many respects he thought
Mervyn filled these requirements, but a mistaken
appraisement of his qualities by his commanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
officer would be an error of fatal results, and somehow
Captain Howard found on sifting his convictions that
he had, albeit for slight cause, lost confidence in Mervyn.
To be sure, Mervyn had in his formal report
rectified the false impression under which he had permitted
the commandant to rest for a time, but Captain
Howard was a straightforward man himself and he
could not easily recover from the impression created
by the captain-lieutenant’s duplicity in standing
by and receiving commendations for the acts of another
man—the fact of being in that other man’s
presence made it a futile folly, which implied a lack
of logic. Oddly enough, logic was one of the essential
requisites on an expedition among the Indians.
Such emergencies might arise that the officer could
only act on his own initiative, and Mervyn seemed
not capable of striking out the most effective course
and holding to it at all odds.</p>

<p>Captain Howard groaned under the weight of
responsibility. He was compelled to trust the lives
of a score of his men to the wisdom or unwisdom of
his selection of an officer to command them. While
Mervyn, by virtue of his rank, had the first claim
to the conduct of an important matter requiring tact,
discretion, mental poise, he was ruled out of the possibilities.
He was too self-conscious, too uncertain,
too slack in judgment, too obtuse to fine distinctions.
Ensign Innis also was out of the question. He was
too young, too inexperienced, and Ensign Lawrence
was too young, not only in years, but in mind,—a
mere blundering boy. It would be suicidal to match<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
his unthinking faculties against the subtle wiles of the
sages of the upper towns. Lieutenant Jerrold then
it must be,—but Jerrold was the most literal-minded
of men! He was absolutely devoid of imagination,
of speculation, of that capacity to see through the
apparent fact to the lurking truth beyond. He was
a very efficient man in his place, but his place was a
subordinate station. He would do with thoroughness
the obviously necessary, but he would not be
conscious of an emergency till it was before his feet
as a pitfall, or immediately in his path as an enemy.
He would take the regulation precautions, but he
would not divine a danger, nor detect duplicity, nor
realize a subtlety which he did not share. He was
the predestined victim of ambush. He was a martinet
on the drill ground and a terror at inspection. He
laid great stress on pipe-clay and rotten-stone, and
whatever the stress of the situation the men of his
immediate command always showed up preternaturally
smart. Captain Howard was no prophet, but he felt
he could view with the eye of accomplished fact the
return of Jerrold in ten days with the calm announcement
that there were no British cannon in the
Cherokee country, for he had been given this solemn
assurance by no less a personage than Cunigacatgoah.</p>

<p>Captain Howard did not even consider Bolt for the
enterprise; he was a military machine, incapable of
devising an expedient in emergency or acting on his
own initiative. Besides, his duties as fort-adjutant
were particularly pressing just now in view of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
preparations for the early evacuation of the post
and they could not be delegated. Therefore there
remained only Raymond,—Captain Howard was in
despair as he thought of Raymond and his interpretation
of his orders to “persuade” the missionary
to return. Impulsive, headstrong, eager, quick,
indefatigable, emotional, imaginative,—what room
was there for prudence in this fiery temperament!
Still, he had shown a degree of coolness at the encounter
of the boat with the Tamotlee Indians, and had
given the soldiers an excellent example of imperturbability
under the stress of exciting circumstances.
But this was his element,—the contact of actual
contention,—the shock of battle so to speak. How
would he restrain himself when outwitted,—how
would he gather few and feeble resources and make
the best of them,—how might he see fit to tamper
with his instructions and obey or not as he liked,—or
if a right judgment found those orders based on
fallacious premises, unknown to the commandant,
how should he have discretion to modify them and
act on his own initiative, or would he, like Bolt,
persist in following the letter if it destroyed the spirit
of his instructions? Oh, it was hard to be reduced to
a choice of a madcap ensign, in this matter of paramount
importance? He could not, he would not, send
Raymond—his impetuosity was enough to bring
the whole Cherokee country about their ears.</p>

<p>He shook his head, scowling unwittingly, as he
chanced to catch sight of Raymond while crossing
the parade, and still uncertain and morosely cogitating,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
he took his way to the commandant’s office and
disappeared from vision.</p>

<p>On the space beyond the parade Raymond and
Arabella were greatly exercised in marking out a
course for her archery practice. The promise of a
fair day had been joyously fulfilled. The breeze
was fresh, but bland and straight from the south;
despite the leafless forests the sun shone with a vernal
brilliance; a flock of wild geese going northward passed
high over the fort, the cry, unfamiliar to Arabella,
floating down to her ears, and she stood as long as
she could see them, her head upturned, her hat fallen
on the ground, her eyes following their flight as the
wedge-shaped battalion deployed through the densely
blue sky: there seemed even a swifter movement
in the current of the river, and through the great gate
one could from the parade catch sight of a white glister
on the face of the waters where the ripples reflected
the sun.</p>

<p>So soft was the air that the young lady wore no
cloak. Her close-fitting gown of hunter’s green
cloth, opening over a vest and petticoat of sage-tinted
paduasoy, brocaded in darker shades of green,
was not out of keeping with the woodland suggestions
of the bow which she held in her hand and the quiver
already slung over her shoulder, its gorgeous polychromatic
tints rendering her an object of mark in
the brilliant sunshine from far across the parade.
But she paused in her preparations to lament the
lack of the uniform of the archery club which she had
left in the oak press of her room at home, and Raymond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
listened as she described it, with her picture,
thus arrayed, as vivid in his mind as the actual sight
of her standing there, her golden hair glimmering in
the sun, her white hands waving to and fro as she
illustrated the features of the uniform and recounted
the contentions of taste, the cabals and heart-burnings,
the changes and counter-changes which the club had
shared before at length the triumph of costume was
devised, and made and worn before the acclaiming
plaudits of half the county.</p>

<p>“Faint green,” she said, “the very shade for a
Diana,—”</p>

<p>“I like a darker green,—Diana wears a hunter’s
green,” he interrupted.</p>

<p>“Why do you think that?” she asked, nonplussed,
her satisfaction a trifle wilted.</p>

<p>“I know it,” he said, a little consciously; and as she
still stared at him, he went on: “hunter’s green is
the shade of the forest verdure,—it is a tint selected
not only for beauty but to deceive the keen vision of
game. It stands to reason that Diana should wear
a hunter’s green.”</p>

<p>She meditated on this view for a few moments in
silence, and the eyes of Lieutenant Jerrold, as he loitered
in the door of the mess-hall, noted their eager
absorption as they stood in the grassy space between
the commandant’s quarters and the block-house in
the bastion, in which was situated the mess-hall.
There were a few trees here, still leafless, and a number
of the evergreen shrubs of the region, either spared
for shade where they originally grew, or transplanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
by some earlier commandant, voicing as clearly as
words a yearning homesickness for a colonial or an
English garden, and now attaining a considerable
height and a redundant spread of boughs. An English
rose, now but leafless brambles, clambered over
the doorway of the commandant’s quarters, and along
a hedgerow of rhododendron, which reached the proportions
of a wind-break, protruded some imported
bulbous plants of a simple sort, whether crocus or
hyacinth, one could hardly judge from so slight a
tip piercing the mould. The bare parade was quiet
now; earlier in the morning there had been roll-call
and guard-mounting; and Mervyn, released from
duty as officer of the day, could also see from where
he sat in the mess-hall the interested attitudes of
the two as they paused in their preparations for
target practice to enjoy the pleasures of conversation.</p>

<p>“The benighted ninny!” Mrs. Annandale, commenting
on Mervyn, said to herself in pettish despair,
watching the <i>tête-à-tête</i> from the window of the
commandant’s parlor,—she had promised Arabella
to witness her proficiency from this coigne of
vantage, for the outer air was too brisk without the
off-set of active exercise, “Why <i>doesn’t</i> George Mervyn
join them?” For she had observed Mervyn
as he had quitted the orderly room, and marked his
start of surprise and relaxed pace as his eyes fell upon
the two,—then his dogged affectation of indifference
as he briskly crossed to the block-house in the bastion.</p>

<p>“Hunter’s green is the wood-nymph’s wear forever,”
Raymond declared, eying Arabella as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
stood in distinct relief against the darker green of
the rhododendron hedge, in the flickering sunshine
and shade under the branches of a balsam fir. “But
I have no doubt,” he continued, with a sudden courteous
afterthought, “that the archery uniform,
though not designed with a strict view of sylvan
utility, was very smart in faint green.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was,—it was,”—she acceded, with ready
good-humor. “It was relieved with white—”</p>

<p>“Oh, another tone of green, by all means,” he
blurted out impulsively, and now he had some ado
to catch himself in this inadvertence—was he dull
enough, he asked himself, to openly worship in
set phrase the gown she now wore? “Was the relief
a dead white,—like our pipe-clay gear?” he critically
demanded.</p>

<p>“No-o—what they call a white silver cloth, now-a-days,
and with a little cap of white silver cloth, with
a tinsel half-moon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a lady is so fair,—the caps ought to have
been a dark green to set off an exquisite fairness,—and
a broad hat, a furry beaver hat, would have been
prettier in my eyes than a cap.”</p>

<p>Oh, fool! seeming much confused now, and just
remembering that it is her hat—her broad furry
beaver hat—in your mind, lying there in the sand, with
its drooping feather and its long strings of wide sage-green
ribbon to tie under her delicate chin. No
wonder you turn deeply red, and begin to try the
bow-line of a great unstrung Indian bow with all your
strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“But all ladies are not fair,” she protested. “That
white silver cloth cap was Eva Golightly’s selection to
set off her black hair,—she wears no powder,—that
is, not on her hair!”</p>

<p>He laughed gayly at the imputation, and the roguish
glance of her eyes encountered in his a candid mutual
enjoyment of the little fling.</p>

<p>“But it is a charming costume,” she went on,
“and so convenient,—with no hanging sleeves, nor
lappets or frills to catch at the bow and arrow as one
shoots,—everything laid on in plain bands,—I
wish I had not left it at home, but of course I did not
dream I should have any such lovely chance to shoot
here.”</p>

<p>“And why not, pray?—the land of the bow and
arrow!”</p>

<p>“How could I imagine I should be furnished with
these adorable toys—just the proper weight and
size. I could not handle a real bow like yours, for
instance. It is a weapon in truth!”</p>

<p>She suddenly held out her bow to exchange for
experiment, and lifting the long, straight, heavy
weapon, she sought to bend it from the perpendicular
to string it. The stout wood resisted her force, and
she paused to admire its smooth grain, which had
a sheen like satin. He did not think its history
worth telling,—a grewsome recollection for so fair
a day! He had taken it from a Cherokee warrior
whom he had slain during the late war in a hand-to-hand
conflict—a desperate encounter, for the Indian
had held him half doubled by a clutch on his powdered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
and perfumed hair, and the scalp-knife had
grazed his forehead before he could make shift
to fire his pistol, twice flashing in the pan, into his
captor’s heart. He had no time to reload, and snatching
up the bow of his adversary he had fitted and
shot an arrow with fatal effect at a tribesman who
was coming up to his comrade’s assistance; then
Raymond made good his retreat, carrying the bow
as a trophy.</p>

<p>It was indeed a weapon. “Terrible was the clanging
of the silver bow” as he strung it and then drew
back the cord to try it, and then let it fly again.
Arabella exclaimed with a shrilly sweet delight at
the unexpected resonance of the taut bow-line. He
fitted an arrow and drew back, sighting carefully
at the target. This was a board painted white, with
several dark circles about a bull’s-eye, affixed against
a tree, beyond which was the blank interior slope of
the rampart, and above, the red clay parapet surmounted
by the long line of the stakes of the tall
stockade. Captain Howard, himself, had selected
the spot. In common with all regulars he believed—and
fire cannot scorch this faith out of them—that
only the trained soldier can fight, or shoot, or acquire
any accuracy of aim. He had therefore placed
the flower of the archery club where her quartz-tipped
arrows, if wide of the mark, could only pierce the
heavy clay embankment and endanger the life and
welfare of neither man nor beast. Suddenly Raymond
let fly the shaft, testing the wind. It had
fallen now to the merest zephyr, and did not swerve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
the arrow a hair’s breadth from the mark. It struck
fair and full in the bull’s-eye, for these frontier officers
often were called upon to defend their lives with
their own hands, and sought skill in marksmanship,
a steady hand, a trained eye, and a cool head as zealously
as did the rank and file.</p>

<p>The youthful Diana, her draperies flying in the
motion as she sped through shadow and sheen, gained
the target as quickly as he. As he recovered his arrow
he was laughing with flattered pleasure noting her
eagerness to assure herself of the accuracy of his aim,
while she uttered little exclamations of wonder and
delight at his efficiency.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you make them stare in Kent?” she
cried breathlessly, as the two raced together swiftly
to the starting-point.</p>

<p>Then she selected an arrow from her gorgeous little
quiver, hanging over her shoulder, and fitted the
shaft to the bow. It was the prettiest attitude
imaginable as she stood in the mingled shadow and
sheen, her golden hair glimmering in the sun, and
drawing the cord took careful aim. Her arrow sprang
smartly from the string, sped through the air, and
entered one of the circles so close to the centre as
to justify Raymond’s joyous cry of congratulation,
echoing through the parade.</p>

<p>“Gad! I think I’ll see this thing through!”
Jerrold exclaimed, as he still stood in the mess-room
door. He turned to the wall, and took down a bow
that had been used there for ornament rather than
a weapon. As he approached across the parade he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
noticed that the face of every passer-by was turned
with smiling eyes toward the spirited and handsome
young couple, and when he came up and was greeted
genially by Raymond, and with a gracious word of
welcome by the lady, he thought sagely that the
best archer on the ground was invisible, and that
the prettiest shots were not registered on the target.</p>

<p>The absence of Mervyn seemed the more significant
now, since the other young officers not on duty were
occupied in the gallant endeavor to make the archery
practice of the young lady more interesting and
exciting by competition. As he dully sulked in the
deserted mess-hall, he had the cold comfort of perceiving
that his presence was by no means essential
to the young lady’s enjoyment of the occasion. Her
musical, ringing laughter, now much heartier than
either Mrs. Annandale or Mervyn thought becoming
or consonant with the simpering ideals of the times,
was blended with the very definite merriment of the
young officers, who by no means had been taught to
“laugh by note.” Jerrold’s entrance to the pastime
had added greatly to its gayety. He was a fair shot
with fire-arms, but he entertained, of course, great
contempt for the bow and arrow as a weapon. He
had no sort of appreciation of its grace in usage nor
interest in the romantic details of its archaic history,
either in civilized countries of eld or in this new
and savage world. In his literal mind the mighty
bow-men of whatever sort were a set of inefficient
varlets, whom a pinch of gun-powder might justly
put to rout. Hence he scarcely knew how to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
hold of the weapon. He had not even taxed his
observation with its methods, although he had often
seen Indian hunters use it in shooting at game, and
more than once, since the scarcity of powder among
the Cherokees, a forlorn destitute wight seek to defend
his life with its dubious and precarious aid. Therefore
there was much glee on the part of the two experts
when Jerrold claimed his turn; after several efforts
he awkwardly contrived to draw the bow and sent
an arrow feebly fluttering through the air to fall to
the ground a few paces distant. Arabella clapped
her hands like a child as she burst into melodious
peals of laughter, and Raymond’s amusement at this
travesty of archery was hardly less spontaneous.
Though vastly superior, they showed themselves not
grudging of their proficiency; they undertook to
instruct Jerrold in correct methods, one standing on
either side of him and both talking at once. Suddenly
Raymond called out sharply to Arabella,
cautioning her lest she pass between the archer and
the target. “For heaven’s sake,—for mercy’s sake,”
he adjured her solemnly, “pray be careful!”</p>

<p>She flushed deeply at the tone; it thrilled in her
heart; the next moment her heart was aching with
the realization that it was of no special significance.
Any one might caution another with a reckless exposure
to danger.</p>

<p>“I fancy the safest place is between the archer and
the target when Mr. Jerrold shoots,” she said laughing.</p>

<p>Then again ensued the farce of Jerrold’s efforts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the faltering shaft falling far short of the mark,—with
such wide divergence, indeed, even from the
line of aim, that Captain Howard’s disposition of
the target in so remote a spot was amply justified.
As once more the joyous laughter rang forth in which
Jerrold, himself, readily bore a sonorous part, Mervyn
suddenly joined the group. He had gained nothing
by his absence, and indeed he could no longer nurse
his anger in secret to keep it warm.</p>

<p>“What is all this?” he asked curtly, glancing about
him with an air of disparagement.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see?” returned Jerrold. “It is archery
practice.”</p>

<p>“Will you shoot?” Raymond suggested, civilly
offering him the bow which he had used himself.</p>

<p>Mervyn hesitated. He thought himself a fair
bowman, but he fancied from the state of the target
and what he had heard of the acclaim of success that
Raymond had made some very close hits. He feared
lest he might come off a poor second. He was not
willing to be at a disadvantage in Arabella’s presence
even in so small a matter. He resented, too, the
sight of her use of Raymond’s gift,—the beautiful
bow in her hand, the decorated quiver, with its
crystal-tipped arrows, hanging from its embroidered
strap over her dainty shoulder. He could not refrain
from a word that might serve to disparage them.</p>

<p>“No,” he refused, “I don’t care for archery. It
is a childish pastime.”</p>

<p>“I am beholden to you, sir!” exclaimed Arabella,
exceedingly stiffly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>She really was so expert as to render her proficiency
almost an accomplishment, and she was of
a spirit to resent the contemptuous disparagement
of a pastime which she so ardently affected.</p>

<p>“I mean, of course, for men and soldiers,” Mervyn
qualified, with a deep flush, for her tone had brought
him suddenly to book.</p>

<p>“The bow-men of Old England?” she said, with
her chin in the air.</p>

<p>“They had no better weapons,” he reminded her,
with an air of instruction. “And their victories
were not child’s play. It was the best they could
do.”</p>

<p>“And this is the best that I can do!” she said,
fitting an arrow to the bow and throwing herself into
that attitude of incomparable grace.</p>

<p>Whether it was an accident, whether she had made
an extraordinary effort, whether the discord, the
nettled displeasure, the roused pride, served to steady
her nerves, as self-assertion sometimes will do, the
arrow, springing from the string, cleft the air with
a musical sibilance that was like a measure of song,
and flying straight to the mark struck the bull’s-eye
fairly and stuck there, rendering the feat absolutely
impossible of disallowance.</p>

<p>Raymond’s delight knew no bounds. He sympathized
so in her pleasure. They looked at each
other with wide, brilliant eyes full of mutual joy, and
ran together to the target to make sure of what was
already assured. As they came back both were
laughing excitedly, and Raymond was loudly talking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
“Let us leave it there to show to Captain Howard.
He will never believe it else. Let not another arrow
be shot till then, lest somebody strike the target and
the jar bring this arrow down.”</p>

<p>“Except Mr. Jerrold!” Arabella stipulated, with
a gush of laughter. “There is no danger of his hitting
the target, far or near.”</p>

<p>“Yes,—yes,—” exclaimed Raymond, adopting
the suggestion. “Here, Jerrold, value your special
privileges! You only may draw the bow.”</p>

<p>Jerrold braced himself to the endeavor, good-naturedly
adopting the advice of each in turn as they
took up their station, one on either side.</p>

<p>“Slip your left hand lower!” Raymond urged.</p>

<p>“Oh, you <i>must</i> hold the arrow steady!” Arabella
admonished him.</p>

<p>“Now aim,—aim,—man!” Raymond prompted.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take sight, Mr. Jerrold?” Arabella
queried.</p>

<p>Mervyn, looking on disaffectedly as all were so
merrily busy, noticed that two or three soldiers who
passed near enough to see down the little grassy
glade among the trees sensibly slackened their pace
in their interest in the commotion, and, indeed, the
whole scene was visible to the sentries at the gate,
the warder in the tower, and to a certain extent from
the galleries of the barracks.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it is injudicious, Jerrold,” he
remarked, with distant displeasure, “to make yourself
ridiculous in the eyes of the men of your command?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said Jerrold, lightly. “They know it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
is capital punishment to ridicule me. Make your
mind easy.”</p>

<p>“It must lessen your influence!” Mervyn persisted.
He hardly knew what he wanted in this argument.
He did not care a fig for Jerrold’s influence over the
men. He only desired some subterfuge to break up
the merry-making in which he did not choose to
share.</p>

<p>Jerrold did not even answer. Arabella on one
side was offering a dozen suggestions tending to
improve his aim, and Raymond was by precept and
example endeavoring to get him into the right posture.</p>

<p>“Now,—hold steady for a minute before you
shoot,” said Raymond.</p>

<p>“If you only could count ten in that position without
moving,” suggested Arabella.</p>

<p>“Or better still, repeat the Cherokee invocation for
good aim,” Raymond proposed. “Might improve
your luck.” And he continued sonorously: “<i>Usinuli
yu Selagwutsi Gigagei getsu neliga tsudandag
gihi ayeliyu, usinuliyu. Yu!</i>” (Instantly may the
Great Red magic arrow strike you in the very centre
of your soul.)</p>

<p>“Oh, repeat it! repeat it!” cried Arabella. “Try
it, and see if it will really mend your aim! What
strange, strange words!”</p>

<p>Jerrold was haltingly repeating this after Raymond
when Captain Howard came out of his office, and seeing
the group took his way toward it. Raymond’s
back being toward him, he did not perceive the commandant’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
approach and continued the invocation,
delivering it <i>ore rotundo</i> in imitation of the sonorous
elocution of the Indians.</p>

<p>It sounded very clever to Captain Howard, who
always declared he envied the facility with which
the young officers picked up the colloquial use of the
Indian languages. He took no trouble himself to
that end, however. In his adoption of the adage
with reference to the difficulty of teaching an old
dog new tricks, he did not adequately consider the
disinclination of the dog to the acquisition of fresh
lore. The younger men were more plastic to new
impressions; they exerted a keener observation;
and felt a fresher interest, and few there were who
had not some familiarity with the tongue and traditions
of the tribe of Indians about the fort, and
those among whom their extensive campaigns had
taken them.</p>

<p>“What does all that mean?” Captain Howard
asked curtly.</p>

<p>Raymond translated, and explained Jerrold’s predicament
and his need of luck in default of skill.
Then he turned with animation toward the target,
to celebrate the famous hit of Miss Howard’s arrow
in the bull’s-eye while she stood flushing and smiling
and prettily conscious beside him. But Captain
Howard laid a constraining hand on his arm and
looking at him with earnest eyes, demanded, “Where
did you get all that Cherokee stuff?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in the campaigns in the Cherokee country,”
Raymond answered, “I picked up a deal of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
lingo.” For Raymond had served both in Montgomery’s
campaign and Grant’s subsequent forays
through this region two years ago, and his active
mind had amassed much primitive lore, which, however,
he had never expected to use in any valuable
sort.</p>

<p>“Were you ever in Choté, Old Town?” queried
the captain.</p>

<p>“I was there on one occasion, sir” said Raymond
now surprised and expectant.</p>

<p>“Then go there again,—take twenty picked men,—your
own choice,—and set out to-morrow at
daybreak. Report for final orders this evening at
retreat.”</p>

<p>Arabella, dismayed and startled, felt her heart
sink. She turned pale and tremulous; she did not
know if a cloud passed over the sun, but for her the
light of the day was quenched. She could not understand
Raymond. His face was transfigured with
a glow of delight. She could not imagine the zest
of such an employ to a young officer, brave, ardent,
eager to show his mettle, ambitious of any occasion
of distinction. This was his first opportunity. A distant
march,—a separate command of experienced
soldiers,—even if only twenty! The dignity of
the prospect set Raymond all a-quiver. What cared
he for the jungles of the wild mountains, the distance,
the toils, the danger! As to the Indians,—it behooved
the nations to look to their safety when he
was on the march with twenty men at his back! His
cheek was scarlet; his eyes flashed fire; he responded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
with a staid decorum of acquiescence, but it was
obvious that in his enthusiasm for the opportunity
he could have fallen at the feet of the commandant
and kissed his hands in gratitude.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> Arabella’s amazement the other officers looked
nettled, even resentful, as if disparaged in some
sort. Mervyn indeed wore an expression of blank
dismay as if he hardly knew how he should interpret
this setting aside of himself in favor of his subordinate.
He could not altogether restrain himself, and
with a cold smile and a stiff dignity he said presently,
“We have all learned more or less of the Cherokee
language.”</p>

<p>“Well,—well,—it is no great matter, for of
course the official interpreter goes with the party.”
Captain Howard, so to speak, shouldered the affair
aside. He could well understand, however, the
mortification of Mervyn and Jerrold that they should
be passed over for a younger officer and only an
ensign in rank. But he had had the evidence of his
senses to Raymond’s knowledge of the Cherokee
language, and this confirmed him in the selection which
he had already considered. He was glad to discover
this particular fitness in the man of his choice for this
delicate and diplomatic mission, one who would be
keenly alive to all he might hear or see on festive
or informal occasions when no interpreter could be on
duty.</p>

<p>Raymond now had not a word to say, and presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
he excused himself with a look of importance and the
plea that he desired to glance over the roll and select
the men for the expedition, to make sure that all
were fit, and properly equipped for the march.</p>

<p>When he had quitted the group a silence ensued,
heavy with the unspoken reproach of the captain-lieutenant.
The commandant felt constrained to
some casual comment: “The trouble with very young
men is that they are too disposed to underestimate
difficulties,—too cock-sure. Raymond would be as
well pleased with the assignment if the march were
five hundred miles instead of one hundred and fifty!”</p>

<p>“And so should I,” said Mervyn, suggestively.</p>

<p>“Tut! Tut! You young men shouldn’t be so
grudging,” said Captain Howard, making the best
of the untoward situation. “Give a man a chance
to show that he holds his commission for some better
reason than the purchase money. Gad, sir, don’t
grudge him so!”</p>

<p>As he turned away Jerrold, recovering himself
from his disappointment as best he might, thinking
it a matter which he could more fittingly deplore
in secret and seclusion at another time, sought to
obviate the awkwardness of the discussion by inviting
Captain Howard’s attention to his daughter’s
fine shot, the arrow still sticking in the bull’s-eye.
Captain Howard responded alertly, grateful indeed
for the opportune digression, and walked briskly
down to the target with the fair Arabella hanging
on his arm, Jerrold at his side, and Mervyn still
sullenly preoccupied, following slowly. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
pleasure of the day for Arabella was done and dead.
Her father’s outcry of surprise and approbation
and commotion of applause, she felt was fictitious and
affected,—the kind of affectionate flattery which one
offers a child for some infantile conceit. It was a
matter of supreme inutility in his estimation whether
she could shoot with a bow or not, and his mind was
busied with more important details. Jerrold’s
phrases of commendation as the group stood before
the target and commented on the position of the arrow
were of no value, for he knew naught of the difficulty
of the achievement. Mervyn could really appreciate
the exploit itself, but Raymond valued it adequately,
more than all because it was hers, and he took pride
and pleasure in her graceful proficiency. She had
had a glow of satisfaction in a good thing in its way
well done; she had been proud and pleased and
well content with such honestly earned admiration,
but now her satisfaction was all wilted; and when
her father said, “There now, daughter, run away,—enough
for this morning,—run into the house, dear,”
she was quite ready to obey, and grateful for her
dismissal and the breaking-up of the party. Mervyn,
to her infinite relief, did not offer to follow her. His
mind was all on the expedition to Choté, which Ensign
Raymond was to command, and he walked off with
Jerrold and the captain, thinking that even yet
something might befall to induce the commandant
to countermand his orders and make a change in the
personnel of the force.</p>

<p>Arabella was sure she was not tired, for a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
exercise such as she had taken was hardly enough
to tax her buoyant, youthful vigor, but she felt as she
reached the stairs that she had scarcely strength to
ascend the flight. She turned back to the room that
served as parlor, rejoicing to find it vacant. She
sank down in one of the great chairs before the fire,
which was dull and slow this bland day; the wood
was green, the sap had risen and was slowly oozing
out at the ends of the logs and dripping down on the
ash below. It had a dulcet sibilance in the heat;
it was like some far-off singing, which she could hear
but could not catch the melody. As she vaguely
listened to this elfin minstrelsy she wondered if Raymond
would go without a word of farewell,—she
wondered if the expedition were of special danger.
She pressed her hands against her eyes to darken her
vivid imaginings. Oh, why should such risks be
taken! She wondered if he would ever return,—and
then she wondered if her heart had ceased to beat
with the thought.</p>

<p>Never, never had she imagined she could be so unhappy,—and
here, where she had so longed to come.
She gazed about the room with its rude construction
metamorphosed by its barbaric decorations of feathers,
and strange weapons, and curious hangings of
aboriginal weavings, and rugs, and draperies of fur,
and thought how often she had pictured the place
to her mind’s eye in England from her father’s letters,
and how she had rejoiced when her aunt had declared
that now that the war was over they would visit
the commandant in his own fort. And what a tumult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
of anxiety, and fear, and doubt, and desolation
had whelmed her here!—and would he go without
a word?</p>

<p>It seemed just and fitting that the sky should be
overcast as the day wore on,—that clouds should
gather without as the light had failed within. The
air continued mild; the fire dully drooled; and
when she asked her father at the dinner-table if the
expedition would set forth if it should rain, he laughed
with great gayety and told her that frontier soldiers
were very particular never to get their feet wet—a
not altogether felicitous joke, and indeed he was no
great wit, for Mrs. Annandale tartly demanded why
if they were allowed to be so particular were they not
furnished with pattens. This Captain Howard considered
very funny indeed, seeing doubtless in his
mental vision the garrison of Fort Prince George
thus accoutred; he laughed until Arabella admonished
him that he should not be so merry when perhaps
he was sending a score of men to a dreadful
death at the hands of savages, who were eager and
thirsting for blood, in a wilderness so dense and sombre
and drear that she thought that Milton, or Dante,
or anybody who had sought to portray hell, might
have found a new expression of desolation in such
mysterious, impenetrable, trackless forests. Then
truly he became grave.</p>

<p>“Raymond’s mission is not one of aggression,” he
said. “I have thrown what safe-guards I could
about him. I trust and I believe he will be safe if
he conducts properly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“And what is his mission, sir?” asked Arabella.</p>

<p>“Do you expect me to tell you that when he
does not know it himself?” said her father, laughing.
“He is not to open his sealed instructions till he
reaches Choté, Old Town.”</p>

<p>Arabella’s eyes were wide with dismayed wonder.
To her this seemed all the more terrible. To thrust
one’s head into the lion’s jaws, not knowing whether
the beast is caged or free, ravenous or sated, trained
or wild. She said as much to Ensign Raymond
himself, when after candle-light he came in to pay
his devoirs and take a formal farewell of the household.
He was in great spirits, flushed and hilarious—very
merry indeed when he found that Arabella was in
much perturbation because he, himself, was in the dark
as to the tenor of his mission, and would be one hundred
and fifty miles distant in the heart of the Cherokee
country ere he discovered the nature of his duty.</p>

<p>“Suppose it proves contrary to your own views
and wishes,” Arabella argued.</p>

<p>“A soldier must have no views and wishes contrary
to his duty,” he laughed.</p>

<p>“But suppose you find it is impossible!”</p>

<p>“I have too much confidence in the commandant to
believe he would set me an impossible task.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be too sure of that,” interpolated Mrs.
Annandale, who was benign, almost affectionate in
her manner toward him, now that she was about
to be rid of this handsome marplot, who did as much
damage to her darling scheme by the unholy influence
his presence exerted on Mervyn’s temper as by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
own magnetic personality. “Poor dear Brother
was always a visionary.”</p>

<p>Raymond burst out laughing at the idea of the
commandant as a dreamer of dreams. “I have such
faith in whatever visions he may entertain as to be
certain they will materialize at Choté Great!”</p>

<p>“Will you be sure to come back?” Arabella asked,
as they stood at the last moment near the table where
the candles threw an upward glow on his red coat,
his laughing eyes, his handsome, spirited face, and
his powdered hair. He held his hat in his left hand
and was extending his right hand toward her.</p>

<p>“Will you be sure to come back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, don’t be so solemn,—your tones
might summon a man from the ends of the earth or
a spirit from the confines of being!” cried Mrs. Annandale.</p>

<p>Once more Raymond’s joyous laughter rang
through the room. “I shall come alive if I can conveniently,
and all in one piece. If not I shall revisit
the glimpses of the moon! I shall return—” and
then in a more serious tone, seeing her seriousness,
“I shall return, God willing.”</p>

<p>Mervyn himself entertained considerable doubt of
this happy issue of the expedition. He thought
Raymond far too young, too flighty, too inexperienced
to be trusted at such a distance, unhampered by
authority, subject to strange untried conditions which
could not be foreseen and provided against. It
was necessary that all the details should be confided
to his own unaided judgment, and it would not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
greatly astonished the captain-lieutenant if none
of the party should ever be seen again alive. In the
dense jungles of the mountain wilderness, in the power
of an implacable, aggrieved, and savage people, the
fate of this handful of soldiers might ever remain a
mystery and unavenged. The thought softened
his heart toward his quondam friend. Mervyn was
of the temperament rarely consciously at fault; so
little did he admit dereliction in his relations with the
outside world that he was often self-deceived. But
in this instance his conscience stirred. He realized
that for his offended vanity, for an unspoken fleer in
a man’s eyes which his own coxcombry had provoked,
he had in revenge caught at an immaterial matter
in the guard report and contrived to wreak his displeasure
on Raymond in a sort most calculated to
wound him, subjecting him to a reprimand, unwilling
though it was, from the commandant. After that
event ensued an alienation as complete as their
friendship had formerly been close. At the time
he winced to discover that Raymond had the magnanimity
to refrain from retorting in kind, and had
not held him up to ridicule in the commandant’s eyes
by gossiping on the expedition to Tamotlee of his
unlucky absence from the scene of the conflagration.
To be sure, Raymond knew that fact would be elicited
in the regular channels of the reports, but he had
not gone out of his way to further his false friend’s
mortification. Mervyn wished now that he had been
less morose, less intractable. He had, he thought,
no reason to be jealous of Raymond’s station in Arabella’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
esteem. He was a dashing, attractive, handsome
man, well calculated to entertain and amuse a young
lady who was not used to spend her time in so dull
a place as a frontier fort. Mervyn had no serious
fault to find with the encouragement which she had
vouchsafed his own suit. Therefore why should he let
the breach yawn and widen between himself and his
former friend. He did not linger in the commandant’s
parlor after Raymond had made his adieus, but followed
him to his quarters, where he found the ensign
with his servant busily packing his effects for the
march.</p>

<p>“Just as I expected,” said Mervyn, ignoring Raymond’s
stare of surprise, and perching himself on
one end of the table as of old in the scarcity of chairs;
he carelessly eyed the confused medley of articles
spread over the bed, the chairs, the floor. “Making
ready for the march, are you? I came to see if
you wouldn’t like to borrow my otter fur great coat
and my heavy lynx rug for the trip. There is a
change in the temperature impending,—freezing
weather,—and you might need them.”</p>

<p>Raymond hesitated. He would not wish to
churlishly refuse an overture for renewed friendship
or, as he rightly interpreted this, a covert apology.
But he had that fibre of sensitiveness which winced
from a favor bestowed—not from one he loved; a
month ago he would have welcomed the offer, but
more because of the feeling indicated than the utility
of the proffered gear, although doubtless the furs
would have stood him in good stead. Now, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
his estimate of Mervyn had changed and his heart had
waxed cold toward him. He said to himself that he
would be willing to risk the chance of freezing, if his
own provision were insufficient, rather than be beholden
to Mervyn for aught under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“I am already taking as much weight as I can
afford to carry,” he replied. “And besides your
furs are too costly and delicate to drag through such
a march as this,—thank you, just as much.”</p>

<p>After some words of fruitless insistence Mervyn’s
talk digressed to details of ways and means. He was
graciously disposed to supplement the younger officer’s
presumably inferior knowledge by his more mature
advice, a senior in rank, years, and experience. Unrestrained
by any subtle considerations of feeling on
such a theme, Raymond did not scruple to flout this
unsolicited counsel with a frank abandon which bespoke
a self-confidence expanded to a prideful jubilance
by the importance of the mission with which
he had been intrusted. But this cavalier reception
of the suggestions tendered him did not impair
Mervyn’s urbanity nor hinder the ostensible renewal
of pleasant relations, or rather the ignoring of the
fact that such relations had ever been interrupted.
He offered his hand at parting with many good wishes,
and Raymond, whose quickened intuition had come
to comprehend his mental processes, was glad to see
the door close upon his well-bred dissimulation.</p>

<p>“He does not want to feel at all uncomfortable
in his conscience if I should be unlucky enough to
be scalped, or frozen, or devoured by wolves, or lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
in the wilderness,” he thought, with a bitter insight.</p>

<p>And was this a seemly lover for Arabella Howard?
He wondered how she could tolerate the dissembler
who was not even frank with himself. He wondered
how her father, an epitome of stout-hearted candor,
her aunt, the cleverest of keen-sighted women, would
permit this sacrifice of her. But there were inducements,—rank,
fortune, station,—all powerful to
embellish ugly traits, to obliterate unworthy actions,
to place the most creditable construction on selfish
sentiments. Raymond, however, had not time to
rail at Fate according to her perverse deserts, for the
hour was late, and his departure imminent.</p>

<p>He was gone on the morrow by the time the garrison
was fairly astir, marching out of the gates as the
bugle sounded the reveille. The day broke clouded
and drear; the wind veered to the north; the temperature
fell, and then ensued a long interval of
suspense, of gray monotony. The air became still;
it was perceptibly warmer; the dense clouds hung
low and motionless; it was impossible to prognosticate
the character of the change when it should
terminate the indefinite uncertainty. Occasionally
as the cheerless afternoon wore on, a vague brightening
over the landscape gave a delusive promise of
fairer skies, and then the sullen day lowered anew.
The morrow brought no flattering augury. Now and
then Captain Howard, looking at the heavy clouds,
portending falling weather, meditated anxiously on
the difficulties of the expedition. The temperature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
was unusually uncertain considering the season. He
did not, however, expect a recurrence of cold weather,
with spring already astir in the warm earth. But
with the fickleness of the southern climate, on the
third day after the departure of the little force, a
freeze set in at dawn, and as the temperature moderated
toward noon the threatened falling weather made
good its menace in whirls of snow-flakes.</p>

<p>Captain Howard felt that he could not have been
expected to foresee these climatic changes, and least
of all he anticipated snow, which, most of all, he
dreaded. The mission had already been unduly
postponed, and time pressed sorely. The emergency
was urgent and this he did not doubt, but with the
complication of wintry storms in the wilderness he
began to seriously question the wisdom of his selection
of the officer to conduct the enterprise to a
satisfactory conclusion. He wondered if Raymond
would have the prudence to turn about should the
route prove impracticable through the snowy tangled
forests and across a score of precipitous high mountains
and retrace his way to Fort Prince George.</p>

<p>He felt sure that at the first flurry betokening
now in the trackless mountain defiles either Mervyn
or Jerrold would have ordered an “About-face”
movement. His heart misgave him as he reflected
on Raymond’s pertinacity. He knew in his secret
soul that if ever he saw the ensign again it would
be after he had accomplished his mission to Choté
Great.</p>

<p>“Will he really freeze himself and his twenty men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
first?” he asked petulantly,—“or lose his way in
the storm?”</p>

<p>Mervyn, albeit somewhat anxious himself after the
flakes had begun to whirl, could but experience a
little relish of the discomforts of his superior, who
had apparently passed him over without reason, and
had conferred a duty of difficulty and danger on a
very young officer, probably incapable of executing
it with requisite discretion. He had no inclination
to stay and condole with the commandant before the
fire in the orderly room. Here Captain Howard sat
and toasted his spurs half the morning, having a
mind himself to ride out on the trail of the expedition,
if its route could be ascertained. There was
the usual routine,—the reports of the orderly room,
guard-mounting, drill,—all the various tours of duty
to be observed as rigorously as if the fort held ten
thousand men, instead of its complement of a scant
hundred. Mervyn went about these details with a
military promptness and efficiency and apparent content
which commended him much to the morose commandant,
who wished a hundred times that day that
he had Raymond here and that Mervyn were in
Raymond’s place, thirty miles away,—nay, fifty by
this time.</p>

<p>“He will have those men off their feet,” muttered
Captain Howard. “He’ll race them through these
drifts as if they were sunshine.”</p>

<p>He looked out drearily at the snow now lying
trodden and criss-crossed in devious paths on the
parade. It was untouched, unsullied on the ramparts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
where it had lodged in the clefts between the
sharp points of the stockade. It hung in massive
drifts on the roofs of the barracks, the guard-house
near the gate, the block-houses; icicles wrought by an
arrested thaw depended from the tower, in which the
sentinel was fain to walk briskly to and fro, beating
his breast the while, although the relief came at
close intervals. The flakes were altogether hiding
the contiguous woods, and it seemed that noon had
hardly passed before there were suggestions of dusk
in the darkening atmosphere, and nightfall was early
at hand.</p>

<p>“Wonder where he will bivouac, to-night?” the
commandant suggested to the group of officers in
the mess-hall before the great fireplace that half
filled one side of the room, for they were all somewhat
familiar with the topography of the region
through which Raymond would have to pass and
the names of the Cherokee towns.</p>

<p>It was a cheerful scene indeed. The aroma of a
skilfully compounded punch pervaded it, and the
great silver gilt bowl was genially disposed on the
nearest end of the long table, within easy access of
the group about the hearth. The fire roared joyously
up the great cavernous chimney and was brilliantly
reflected from the glimmering steel of the arms
suspended on the walls,—trophies, curios, or merely
decorations. The wide-spread wings of the white swan
and the scarlet flamingo arranged above the wainscot
in gorgeous alternations hardly now suggested a
mere fiction of flight; they seemed to move, to flutter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
and flicker as the firelight fluctuated and the shadows
danced. On a smaller table there was the steady,
chaste white focus of candle-light, for the tapers
were illumined in two tall candle-sticks, the cards
were cut for Loo, and the expectant faces of the
officers showed in the calm white gleam, with all the
details of their red coats, their white belts, their
powdered hair. Only one of the officers was smoking,
an on-looker at the game, the quarter-master,
but Captain Howard’s snuff-box was repeatedly in
his hands.</p>

<p>They all noted his signs of anxiety and agitation,
but there was not an immediate response to his remark,
for there could be no freedom of speculation
with a superior officer upon the untoward probabilities
of an enterprise which he had chosen to set on
foot. The silence was the less embarrassing because
of the absorptions of the matter immediately in
hand, for the pool was being formed during the deal.
But when the trump was turned, and the players
had “declared,” there was a momentary pause of
expectation, each relying on some tactful comment
of the other. Innis, the blond young ensign, looked
demurely into the fire and said nothing. Lieutenant
Jerrold, having already glanced through his hand and
seeing “Pam” among the cards, thought it hard
lines that the commandant should not betake himself
to his own quarters and cease to interfere with
the game. By way of promoting this consummation
he suggested fatuously:—</p>

<p>“Raymond will pick a spot near good water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Water!” screamed Captain Howard. “Gad,
sir. <i>Pick</i> a spot! Water! In this weather he has
nothing to do but to hold his fool mouth open.
<i>Water!</i>”</p>

<p>The lieutenant’s unhappy precipitancy suggested
the ambush of the highest card, and his eagerness
to utilize it, to the mind of another player, Ensign
Lawrence, who held the lead. He held also the ace
of trumps.</p>

<p>At his sudden cry, “Be civil,—Pam, be civil,”
Captain Howard started from his preoccupation as
if he had been shot, glancing from under his bushy
eye-brows at the table on which the young officer was
banging down the ace with great triumph.</p>

<p>The cabalistic phrase was of course only designed
to secure the immunity of the ace from capture by
“Pam,” but somehow its singular aptness of rebuke
and Captain Howard’s attitude of sensitive expectation
shook the poise of the board. Ensign Lawrence
turned very red, and only clumsily made shift
to gather in the trick he had taken, for “Pam,” of
course, could not be played, his civility having been
bespoken, according to the rules of the game, and the
holder following suit. The other officers made an
effort to conceal their embarrassment. Bolt, the
fort-adjutant, cleared his throat uneasily. The onlooking
quarter-master with the pipe began a sentence,
paused, forgetting its purport midway, and
silence continued till Ensign Innis came hastily to
the rescue with a suggestion which he thought a
masterly diversion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“I suppose it was an important matter which took
Raymond to Choté in such weather, sir?”</p>

<p>Captain Howard withered him with a glance.</p>

<p>“You have been long enough in the service, sir,
to know better than to ask questions,” he replied
sternly.</p>

<p>Then he rose and betook himself forth into the
densely whirling snow, repenting of his irascibility,
calling himself a condemned spoil-sport, and looking
at the sky, which was all of a bleak blackness, as
well as the buffeting flakes would permit. He noted
the blur of orange light flaring out from barrack-windows
and guard-house door, and guided his route
to his own quarters by the situation of these oases
in the surrounding desert of gloom.</p>

<p>His opening door gave him to view a great gush
of firelight and gleam of candles; the room was
perfumed with the sweet odors of the burning hickory
and pine and cedar in the wide chimney and embellished
by the presence of Arabella, whose grace
made every place seem a parlor. Her golden-hued
shawl hung in silken folds from the back of an arm-chair
of the primitive frontier manufacture, and on
the table lay her embroidery-frame, whereon roses
seemed to bud at her magic touch and expand under
the sunshine of her smiling hazel eyes. Her gown
of canary sarcenet had a black velvet girdle and
many black velvet rosettes for trimming, her golden
hair gleamed in the rich glow of the fire, and in her
hand was her lute, graced by long streamers of crimson
ribbon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>Beside her was the captain-lieutenant, all bedight
in the smartest of uniforms, his hair in a long
queue of blond plaits, and with precise side-curls
heavily powdered, a genteel fashion not always
observed on the frontier.</p>

<p>She had been singing to him one of the songs that
had become fashionable at Vauxhall during his long
absence from London, and the air was still vibrant
with the melody of voice and symphony.</p>

<p>And poor Raymond!—Captain Howard’s inconsistent
heart rebelled at the sight of their comfort
and mirth and security,—out in the snow, and the
black night, and the illimitable trackless wilderness
on the march to Choté.</p>

<p>With the thought his anxiety and distrust of the
subaltern’s discretion were reasserted.</p>

<p>“He will reach Choté if he has a man left! I only
hope he won’t harry the town!” he exclaimed in
the extravagance of his disaffection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Ensign Raymond encountered the snow-storm
he was already advanced some two days’ march
on his mission to Choté Great, the “beloved town,”
the city of refuge of the whole Cherokee nation. The
tempest came first in a succession of capricious
flurries; then the whole world seemed a maelstrom
of dizzily whirling flakes. The young officer and his
force pushed on with mettlesome disregard of its
menace, although for days it persistently fell. Afterward
it drifted with the wind into great mounds, it
obscured the trail, hid the landmarks, set many a
pitfall in the deep chasms and over the thin ice
of unsuspected watercourses in narrow and steep
ravines. Night brought hard freezes; the thaws of
the rising temperature at noonday were resolved into
ice at dusk, and the trees, ceasing to drip, were hung
with icicles on every bough and twig. The great
pearly moon, now and again showing above the
mountains through gusty clouds, revealed strange
endless forests glimmering with crystalline coruscations,
despite the obscurity, as if endowed with some
inherent source of light. The bivouac fires made
scant impression on these chill primeval environments;
the flare on the ruddy faces of the young
soldiers, with their red coats and their snatches of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
song and their simple joy in the contents of their unslung
haversacks, paled as it ventured out amidst the
dense mysterious woods. The snowy vistas would
presently grow dim, and shadows thronged adown the
perspective. Before the ultimate obscurities were
reached, the vanishing point, certain alien green glimmers
were often furtively visible,—a signal for the
swift replenishing of the fires and a renewed flaring of
the flames high into the air, with great showers of
sparks and a fierce crackling of boughs. For the
number of wolves had hardly been diminished by the
Cherokee War with the British, so recently at an end,
although the easily affrighted deer and buffalo seemed
for a time to have fled the country. The predatory
animals had doubtless found their account in the
slaughter of the battle-fields, and Raymond’s chief
anxiety at night was the maintenance of the vigilance
of the fire-guard, whose duty it was to feed the protective
flames with fuel. To drive off the beasts with
musketry was esteemed a wanton waste of powder, so
precious was ammunition always on the frontier.
Moreover, the bellicose sound of British muskets was
of invidious suggestion in the land of the sullen and
smarting Cherokees, so reluctantly pacified, and
recently re-embittered by the downfall of secret
cherished schemes of the assistance of the French to
enable them to regain their independence. Now the
French were quitting the country. Canada was
ceded; the southern forts were to be evacuated.
The “great French father” had been overpowered
and forced to leave them to their fate, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
treaties with the British, half-hearted, compulsory,
flimsy of intention, were to be kept or broken at the
peril of their national existence. They resisted this
conviction,—so high had been their hopes. They
had long believed that a confederation of the Indian
tribes under French commanders would drive the
British colonies of the south into the Atlantic Ocean
and the Gulf of Mexico. They had grown heady with
this expectation, and prophetically triumphant.
They were now desperate with the sudden dissolving
of this possibility forever,—vindictively inimical.</p>

<p>There was an incident of the march which might
have seemed to an older man than Raymond far more
menacing than the wolves that patrolled the camp.
Nightly there came visitors to his fire, which was a
little apart from the bivouac of the rank and file, as
beseemed a commander’s dignity. The soldiers were
wont to gaze askance at the guests across the intervening
spaces, as the fire threw their long shadows
upon the snow. Feather-crested shadows they were,
but never the same. Each night certain chiefs from
the town nearest the end of the day’s march appeared
out of the darkness with protestations of welcome to
the vicinity, and sat with the giddy young commander
beside his fire and talked with faces of grave import,
for the smattering of the Cherokee language that Raymond
had picked up was such as might suffice for
casual conversation. The soldiers wondered and
doubted as they watched, for their lives hung on the
discretion of this light-pated youth. They were
brave men enough and versed in Indian warfare,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
but acquainted too with Indian treachery. The war
was over, both with the French and the Indian tribes,
but that gratuitous sacrifice of life, the death of the
few occurring in the interval between the negotiation
of a treaty and the slowly pervading news of the
consummation of peace, has a peculiar horror for
every soldier. They put their own heads together
around the fire and questioned much what could
these men, holding aloof all day, coming darkly,
dubiously with the shadows, have in traffic with their
“Babby” Ensign,—what subject of earnest persuasion.
The lengthened discourse would be drawn out
long after tattoo had sounded, and when the soldiers,
constrained to keep to fixed hours, lay around the
glowing coals like the spokes of a wheel, they still
furtively watched the figure of the gay young commander,
erect, alert, very wide awake in his dapper
trim uniform, and his blanketed feather-tufted
visitors, their eager faces shown by the fitful
flicker and flare of the ensign’s fire. An icy bough
would wave above them, and so chill was the intervening
atmosphere that the leaping flames wrought
no change in its glittering pendants. A star would
frostily glint high, seen through the snow-laden
branches of the pine. Sometimes the clouds would
part and the pearly moon would cast a strange
supernal lustre on the scene,—the great solitary
mountains on every side; the long vacant snowy
valleys glimpsed through some clifty defile; the
shadowy skulking figures of wolves, primeval denizens
of the wilderness; the bivouac of the soldiers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
and these incongruously colloguing figures beside the
officer’s fire.</p>

<p>The words of the visitors appeared destined to be
in vain. For a head which seemed so easily turned
Ensign Raymond’s was curiously hard.</p>

<p>Not go to Choté? They thought it not worth the
while?—he would always ask with a note of affected
surprise, as if the subject had never before been
broached.</p>

<p>For this was the gravamen of their arguments,
their persuasion, their insistence—that he should
not go to Choté.</p>

<p>Was there not Nequassee, on the hither side of
the tumultuous Joree mountains? The head-men of
the Cherokee nation would delight to meet him there
and confer with him on whatever subject the splendid
and brave Captain Howard might desire to open with
them by the mouth of his chosen emissary, Ensign
Raymond.</p>

<p>It was diplomacy, certainly, but it jumped with
Raymond’s adolescent relish of tantalizing, to give
them no intimation of the fact that he, himself, had
as yet no knowledge of the purpose of his embassy,
his instructions being to open his sealed orders at
Choté. Thus he turned, and evaded, and shifted
ground, and betrayed naught, however craftily they
sought to surprise him into some revelation of his
intent.</p>

<p>Only to Choté he must go, he said.</p>

<p>Two Indians who sat with him particularly late
one night, head-men from the neighboring town of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
Cowetchee, were peculiarly insistent,—first, that he
and his command should accept the hospitality of
their municipality, that he, himself, might lie in the
comforts of their “stranger house,” and then, since
he could not so far depart from his orders as to
break up his camp—if he must repair to one of the
Overhill towns—how near was Talassee, just beyond
a precipitous ridge of the mountains, or Ioco, or
Chilhowee, or Citico,—but not to Choté, surely. So
far,—nearly as far as Tellico Great! Not to Choté,—oh,
no; never so far as to Choté!</p>

<p>“But to Choté,” said Ensign Raymond, “to Choté
must I go.”</p>

<p>They never looked at each other, these crafty sages
of Cowetchee. Only the suspicion bred of long experience
could discern aught of premeditation in
their conduct of the interview. One conserved a
peculiarly simple expression. His countenance was
broad, with high cheek bones and a long flat mouth.
He had a twinkling eye and a disposition to gaze
about the camp with a sort of repressed quizzical
banter, as if he found the arrangement of the troops
and their accoutrements, the dress and arms of the
officer, the remnants of his supper, the methods of
its service, the china and silver, all savoring strongly
of the ludicrous and provocative of covert ridicule.
He held his head canted backward as he looked from
half-closed lids, across the shimmering heated air
rising above the coals, into the young man’s face,
infinitely foreign to him. Youth is intensely averse
to the slightest intimation of ridicule, and Raymond,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
with his personal pride, his impulsive temperament,
his imperious exactingness, could not have brooked
it for one moment had he not early observed that
each demonstration was craftily designed to shake
his equilibrium, and preceded some cogent question,
some wily effort to elicit a betrayal of the purport of
his mission to Choté, and only to the “beloved town.”
The other Indian was grave, suave, the typical chief,
wearing his furs and his feathers with an air of distinction,
showing no surprise at his surroundings,
hardly a passing notice indeed. He was erect,
dignified, and walked with an easy light tread, different
in every particular from the jocose rolling gait
affected by the Terrapin.</p>

<p>The giddy Raymond began to pique himself on his
capacity to meet these emergencies which obviously
Captain Howard had not anticipated. They invested
the expedition with a subtler difficulty than either
had dreamed he might encounter. He flushed with
a sense of triumph, and his bright eyes were softly
alight as he gazed on the glowing coals. He bethought
himself with great relish how these adventures
would garnish his account of his trip, and
having naught to do with its official purpose might
serve to regale the fireside group, where a golden-haired
girl might be pleased again to call him “prodigiously
clever.” He was suddenly reminded of the
string of pearls around her bare white throat which
he had noticed at the commandant’s table, with the
depressing reflection that Captain Howard came of
well-to-do people while he, himself, had little but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
his commission and his pay, and that Mervyn was
rich,—rich in his own right,—and would eventually
be a baronet. For here were pearls around the
savage throat of the Terrapin,—pearls indeed of
price. A single gem of his string were worth the
whole of Arabella Howard’s necklace. These were
the fine fresh-water pearls from the <i>Unio margaritiferus</i>
of the southern rivers, and they had a satin-like
lustre and rarely perfect shape, which bespeak a high
commercial value. The Terrapin wore strings of
shell beads, which he appraised more dearly,—the
wampum, or “roanoke” as the southern tribes called
it,—and which fell in heavy fringes over his shirt
of otter fur. He had a collar of more than two hundred
elk teeth; his leggings were of buck-skin and
solid masses of embroidery. As Ensign Raymond’s
well-bred observation, that sees all without seeming
to notice aught, took in these details, he began to
have an idea of utilizing the visit of the Indians in
a method at variance with their weary marching and
counter-marching upon the citadel of his secret,—the
purport of his mission to Choté, Old Town.</p>

<p>He meditated gravely on this, as he sat in his
camp chair by the smooth stump of a great tree,
felled for fuel, on which had been laid his supper,
serving as table, and now holding the case-bottle of
brandy, the contents of which had been offered and
sparingly accepted by the Indians, for the chiefs
were by no means the victims of fire-water in the
degree in which the tribesmen suffered.</p>

<p>“Tus-ka-sah,” Raymond said suddenly, “tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
your real name. I know you are never the ‘Terrapin.’”
For an alias was reputed to be the invariable
rule of Indian nomenclature. The Cherokees were said
to believe that to divulge the veritable cognomen
divested the possession of the owner, destroyed his
identity, and conferred a mysterious power over him
never to be shaken off. Thus they had also war
names, official names, and trivial sobriquets sufficing
for identification, and these only were communicated
to the world at large, early travellers among the tribe
recording that they often questioned in vain.</p>

<p>Tus-ka-sah’s real face showed for one moment,
serious, astute, suspicious, and a bit alarmed, so
closely personal, so unexpected was the question.
Then he canted his head backward and looked out
from under heavy lowered lids.</p>

<p>“La-a!” he mocked. He had caught the phrase
from English settlers or soldiers. “La-a!” he repeated
derisively. Then he said in Cherokee, “If I
should tell you my name how could I have it again?”</p>

<p>Raymond pondered a moment on this curious
racial reasoning. “It would still be yours. Only I
should know it,” he argued.</p>

<p>“La-a!” bleated Tus-ka-sah derisively, vouchsafing
no further reply, while the other Indian
knitted his perplexed brow, wondering how from
this digression he could bring back the conversation
to the trail to Choté.</p>

<p>“I know what your name ought to be,” declared
Raymond.</p>

<p>Once more a sudden alarm, a look of reality flickered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
through the manufactured expressions of the Terrapin’s
face, as if the ensign might absolutely capture
his intimate identity in his true name. Then realizing
the futility of divination he said “La-a!” once more,
and thrust out his tongue facetiously. Yet his eyes
continued serious. Like the rest of the world, he
was to himself an object of paramount interest, and
he experienced a corrosive curiosity as to what this
British officer—to him a creature of queer, egregious
mental processes—thought his name ought to be.</p>

<p>“It ought to be something strange and wonderful,”
said Raymond, speciously. “It ought to be the
‘Jewel King’—or,” remembering the holophrastic
methods of Indian nomenclature—“this would be
better—‘He-who-walks-bedizened.’”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Indian had no longer that predominant
suffusion of ridicule. They were large,
lustrous, and frankly delighted.</p>

<p>“<i>Agwa duhiyu! Agwa duhiyu!</i>” (I am very
handsome), he exclaimed apparently involuntarily.
He glanced down complacently over his raiment of
aboriginal splendor, passing his hand over his collar
of elk teeth and tinkling his many strings of shell
beads, but it was only casually that he touched his
necklace of pearls. The gesture gave Raymond an
intimation as to the degree in which were valued the
respective ornaments. It reinforced his hope that
perhaps the pearls might be purchased for a sum
within the scope of his slender purse. How they
would grace the hair of the fair Arabella, her snowy
neck or arm. To be sure, he could not presume to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
offer them were they bought in a jeweller’s shop
in London. But as a trophy from the wilderness,
curiously pierced by the heated copper spindle, by
means of which they were strung on the sinews of
deer, the price a mere pittance as for a thing of
trifling worth,—surely Captain Howard would perceive
no presumption in such a gift, the young lady
herself could take no offence. Nevertheless, the pearls
were rarely worth giving in a sort he could not hope
to compass otherwise, nor indeed she to own, for, but
for the method of piercing, rated by European standards
their size and lustre would have commanded a
commensurate price.</p>

<p>“I should like to buy a jewel from the great chief,
‘He-who-walks-bedizened,’” said Raymond, his cheek
flushed, his ardent eyes afire. “There would be a
peculiar interest to tell abroad that this was the
necklace of the ‘Jewel King.’”</p>

<p>The Fox flashed an aggrieved and upbraiding
glance upon the Terrapin. Had they come hither to
chaffer indeed of beads, when the trail to Choté lay
open, and by the utmost arts the sages of all the
towns could not thence divert this wayward soldier?</p>

<p>“How much?” demanded “He-who-walks-bedizened.”</p>

<p>He pursed up his lips, canted his head backward,
and set his eyes a-twinkle under their lowered lids.</p>

<p>Raymond’s heart beat fast. He had all the sensitive
pride of a poor man, highly placed socially. He
would not for all the world have offered her the
trifling personal ornament within his means,—such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
compliment as Mervyn might well have paid. He
tingled with jubilance at the thought of an actual
munificence, which her father could not appropriately
forbid her to accept because it was an aboriginal
curio, costing so disproportionately to its beauty
and value.</p>

<p>He laid a guinea on the table.</p>

<p>“La-a!” bleated the Terrapin, in the extremity of
scorn.</p>

<p>Another guinea, and still another, and yet the
Indian shook his head. The Fox, albeit his eyes
gloated upon the gold, as if it appealed to an appetite
independent of his individuality, growled out an
undertone of remonstrance which the Terrapin heeded
no more than if he had not heard.</p>

<p>Money slips fast through the fingers of a poor
man of good station, but Raymond was schooled to a
modicum of prudence by the urgency of his desire to
possess the gems. Realizing that the demands of
Tus-ka-sah would be limited only by his supposed
capacity to pay and his willingness to part with his
gold, he called a halt lest these, being over-estimated,
frustrate the project that had become insistently,
eagerly precious to him.</p>

<p>“Let the great chief name the price of his necklace,”
he suggested a trifle timorously, fearing a
sum beyond the possibility of his wildest extravagance.</p>

<p>The eyes of both the Indians followed the gold
pieces, as he swept them from the table and into
his purse, with a glitter of greed akin to the look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
of a dog who gazes at a bone for which he is too
well trained to beg. Then Tus-ka-sah, with a slow
and circumspect motion, took the pearls from his
neck and spoke with a deliberate dignity.</p>

<p>“When you return to your own country call all
your people together,”—Raymond hardly smiled at
this evidence of the Indian’s idea of the population of
England, so heartily were his own feelings enlisted
in the acquisition,—“tell them this is the necklace
of the ‘Jewel King,’ ‘He-who-walks-bedizened.’
Then name to them the pearls, for they have true
names,—these, the smaller of the string, are the
little fish that swim in the river, and these are the
birds that fly in the clouds. These twelve large ones
are the twelve months of the year,—this, the first,
is the green corn moon; this is the moon of melons;
this the harvest moon; this the moon of the
hunter.” As he told them off one by one, and as
Raymond leaned forward listening like a three years’
child, his cheek scarlet, his dark eyes aglow, the wind
whisking the powder off his auburn hair despite his
cocked hat, the Fox watched the two with indignant
impatience.</p>

<p>If the Terrapin observed the officer’s eagerness he
made no sign,—he only said suddenly:—</p>

<p>“And <i>all</i> are yours—if—you go not to Choté.”</p>

<p>The young officer recoiled abruptly—in disappointment,
in mortification, in anger.</p>

<p>He could not speak for a moment, so sudden was
the revulsion of sentiment. Then he said coldly,
“You trifle with me, Tus-ka-sah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>He checked more candid speech. For prudential
reasons he could not give his anger rein. Harmony
must be maintained. If cordial relations were not
conserved it should not be the ambassador of a
friendly mission to break the peace.</p>

<p>The Cherokees were as eager as he to let slip no
chance. The Fox, understanding at last the trend
of his colleague’s diplomacy, uttered guttural soothing
exclamations. But Tus-ka-sah, perceiving the
reluctance of the officer’s relinquishment of the opportunity,
the eagerness of his desire, his angry
disappointment, sought to whet his inclination and
made a higher bid. He took from some pocket or
fold of his fur garments a buck-skin bag and thence
drew a single unpierced pearl, so luminous, so large,
so satin-smooth, so perfect of contour, that Raymond,
forgetting his indignation at the attempted bribery,
exclaimed aloud in inarticulate delight, for this
indeed was a gem which those who love such things
might well fall down and worship.</p>

<p>It came from the Tennessee River. Tus-ka-sah
made haste to recite its history to slacken the tension
of the difference which had supervened.</p>

<p>The jewel king of the mussels, he said, had worn
it on his breast; but when his shell, which was his
house, was harried and his people scattered, and he
torn ruthlessly out, this treasure fell as spoils to the
victor. Only its custodian was Tus-ka-sah—this
gem belonged to the Cherokee nation—one of the
jewels of the crown, so to speak. And it too had a
name, the “sleeping sun.” The chief paused to point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
from the moony lustre of the great pearl, shown by
the light of the fire, to the pearly lustre of the moon,
now unclouded and splendid in the dark vault of the
deep blue sky.</p>

<p>“The ‘sleeping sun’!” Raymond exclaimed entranced,
remembering Arabella Howard’s joy in the
fancy, and thinking how the unique splendor of this
single pearl would befit her grace.</p>

<p>He had a prophetic intimation of the proffer even
before it came.</p>

<p>“Since you scorn my necklace,” Tus-ka-sah said in
Cherokee, “this—this—the nation will give you
if you go not to Choté, beloved town.”</p>

<p>Raymond had never dreamed that his loyalty could
be tempted by any treasure. He did not pique himself
on his fidelity. It was too nearly the essence of
his individuality, the breath of his life. An honest
man cannot levy tribute for his integrity—he feels
it a matter of course, impossible to be otherwise.
Raymond was dismayed to find his distended eyes
still fixed upon the gem,—they had a gloat of longing
that did not escape the keen observation of the
chiefs. For this was unique. This was a gift no
other could bestow,—it was indeed fit for a princess.</p>

<p>He experienced a vague internal revolt against the
authority of his superior officer. Why did the instructions
specify Choté? Any mission to the head-men
could be as effectively discharged at any of the
seven great “mother-towns.” As to the aversion of
the chiefs to his appearance in the “beloved town,”
this was doubtless some vagary of their strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
savage religion against the errors of which it was
puerile and futile to contend. If they esteemed his
presence at Choté a profanation of the “ever-sacred”
soil, why persist in intruding logic upon their superstition—especially
since compliance would be so
richly rewarded? Moreover, there were practical
considerations in their favor. Choté was yet distant
half a hundred miles, perhaps,—a weary march
in this frozen wilderness for the already exhausted
detachment. Though seasoned to Indian warfare,
they were new to the topography of this particular
region. Hard at hand was the lesser town of Little
Choté—thus even the casual talk of the troops could
not betray him. Captain Howard need never know
that he had not penetrated to Choté Great, “the
beloved city.” He could open here his sealed orders,
accomplish every detail of his mission, he thought,
and yet secure the rich guerdon of his compliance
with so simple a request.</p>

<p>Raymond rose suddenly to his feet, trembling in
every limb. Tempted—tempted thus by a bauble!
Barter his honor for the lustres of the “sleeping
sun”! His face was scarlet. His eyes flashed. His
lip quivered.</p>

<p>“I am a poor man, Tus-ka-sah,” he said, “and
stop me, my heart grows very heavy for the sake of
the ‘sleeping sun.’ I would give gold for it, to the
extent of my power. Gad, I would willingly be
poorer still for its sake. But you cannot bargain
with me for my duty as a soldier. Go to Choté, says
my superior, and to Choté I go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>He could hardly understand the deep disappointment
expressed in the faces of the Indians who consciously
were trembling on the verge of the accomplishment
of their secret design. Tus-ka-sah first
recovered himself with a fleer at the confession of
poverty, so characteristically scorned by the Indians.
“<i>Poor!</i> La-a! <i>Poor!</i>” He stuck his head askew
with an affronting leer that made his grimace as
insulting as a blow. “For no poor man!” he added,
bundling up his great pearl into its buck-skin bag,
with the air of indignantly terminating the interview,
as if he had received the proffer of a sum beneath
contempt for his valuable jewel.</p>

<p>Whether or not he would have devised some return
to the negotiation, a sudden accident definitely terminated
it. At last the great flare of the fire, the
ascending column of heated air, began to affect the
snow congealed upon the boughs of the pine above
their heads. The thawing of a branch effected the
dislodgment of a great drift that it had supported
in a crotch. The snow fell into the fire with a hissing
noise, and in one moment all was charred cinders and
hot mounting steam where once were red-hot coals
and the flash of flames. Raymond called out a warning
to the fire-guard, who were presently kindling
the protective blaze at a little distance, and as his
servant, roused from sleep, began to shift his effects
thither from the despoiled site of his camp, he sat
on the edge of the stump, listening to the growling of
the wolves which, encouraged by the obscurity, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
now dangerously near. He had not marked when
nor how the two Indians had disappeared, but they
were gone in the confusion, and on the morrow he
resumed his march.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the meantime the days dragged slowly by at
Fort Prince George. The snow lay on the ground
with that persistence which the weather-wise interpret
as a waiting for another fall. All out-of-door
diversions were interdicted. Sleighing was not to
be essayed, for it was considered unsafe to venture
beyond the range of the guns. There was no ice
for curling. Save for the boisterous sport of the
rank and file hurling snow-balls at each other about
the parade, when the fall was fresh and the novelty
an appeal to idleness, the storm had brought none
of its characteristic pastimes.</p>

<p>There was a rumor heard in Keowee Town of a
blockade higher up in the mountains, where the fall
had been of unprecedented depth. It became bruited
abroad somehow,—not that aught had been disclosed
of the fact,—perhaps by subtle intuition,
perhaps only because the circumstances warranted
the surmise, that Captain Howard was extremely
uneasy as to the progress and fate of Ensign Raymond
and his soldiers. Now and again an Indian
straggling from some party out on “the winter
hunt” came in at Fort Prince George with a story
of having met the detachment in the wilderness.
He would be eagerly welcomed by Captain Howard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
regaled with French brandy and roast beef to loosen
his tongue, the fraud discovered only when too late,
the man’s description of the personnel of the force,
elicited under keen inquisition, failing to tally with
the facts in a single particular. It was impossible
for Captain Howard to set his mind at ease in the
assurance that all were well and progressing finely,
when the commander was described as a beautiful old
man in buck-skin with a long white beard, or a squat
fat man with a big stomach, and a red face, and a
splendid bag-wig. The fumes of the brandy and
the beef penetrated far beyond the gates of Fort
Prince George, for rumor diffused and extended the
aroma, and Indian idlers made their racial craft
and tact serve the simple purpose of refreshing their
inner man at the government’s expense by the simple
expedient of professing to have seen Ensign Raymond
in the mountains commanding Captain Howard’s
soldiers. So anxious for news did he become that
he seemed to have lost his normal suspicion, and
on each occasion he returned to his hope of trustworthy
information with an eager precipitancy that
made him an easy prey.</p>

<p>Mervyn watched with cynical secret amusement this
exhibition of vacillating character, as he deemed it.
Why had Captain Howard despatched the detachment
if he straightway wanted it back again, he demanded
of himself. He was fond of observing from an outside
standpoint the perplexity and the floundering mistakes
of other men, especially his superiors in military
rank, with the inner conviction how much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
efficiently he could have discharged his obligations
and disposed of the matter were he in their position.
It was perhaps because of mental exercitations of
this nature that he did not respond with the genial
endorsement of the commandant’s course which
Captain Howard obviously expected and coveted,
when he said one evening as they sat in the parlor
before the fire, after dinner, entirely apropos of
nothing:—</p>

<p>“This snow-storm, now—I couldn’t possibly
have foreseen this.”</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes, his bushy brows bent, and
fixed them on Mervyn’s face interrogatively, yet
with a certain challenge of denial.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” Mervyn hesitated, primly, judicially,
“<i>I</i> have never thought the backbone of the
winter broken as yet.”</p>

<p>“Gad, sir—why didn’t you say so?” snapped
Captain Howard. “If you are such a weather-prophet
as to have foreseen a fall of twenty-six inches,—a
thing never heard of before in this region,—why
didn’t you give me the benefit of your wisdom?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” said Mervyn, and there was rebuke even
in his temperate voice, and his expression was calmly
disclaiming, “I did not foresee the depth of the fall,
of course. And it would ill become me to offer
advice to an officer of your experience. I only
thought the winter not fairly ended.”</p>

<p>Despite the chill in the outer air, the flowers seemed
blooming in royal profusion in Arabella’s tambour-frame.
She was constantly busy with the particolored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
skeins in these dark days, scarcely ever
lifting her eyes as she listened. Now she sat close
to the table for the sake of the light from the candles
in the two tall candle-sticks. She had paused to
thread her needle, and glanced up.</p>

<p>“The snow, papa, is out of all reasonable expectation—both
as to season and depth. You must
know that. You couldn’t doubt it, except for your
over-anxious sense of responsibility for the safety
of the expedition. Lord, sir, nobody ever heard,
as you say, of such a snow.”</p>

<p>“That’s no comfort to me,” said Captain Howard,
visibly comforted, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Mervyn, roused from the soft conceits of superiority,
sought to follow her lead.</p>

<p>“I think, since you permit me to express my opinion,
sir, that the detachment is in far less danger
from the inclemency of the weather than from Ensign
Raymond’s inexperience. A judicious officer would
have faced about at once and returned to the fort
before he could be blockaded, with the drifts filling
the mountain defiles. I should, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“And a very damn fool you would have been!”
exclaimed Captain Howard, testily.</p>

<p>“Dear Brother! In <i>Arabella’s presence</i>!” Mrs.
Annandale admonished him, as she sat in her big
arm-chair, busy with her knotting, which she dextrously
accomplished without other illumination than
the light of the fire, which was reflected from the
jewels on her slender twinkling fingers and flashed
back from the glittering beads of her gorgeous knotting-bag.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
She deprecated this caustic discourtesy
to Captain-Lieutenant Mervyn.</p>

<p>“I am not afraid Arabella will learn to swear, and
I don’t see any other harm that anything I say can
do to her,” retorted Captain Howard. He was even
less pleased with the suggestion that the man to
whom he had entrusted the lives of twenty of his
soldiers was an unwise selection, than that, if he
had had more prudential forethought, he might
have divined the coming of the obstructive tempest.</p>

<p>Mervyn was rather more stiffly erect than usual, and
his long pale face had flushed to the roots of his
powdered hair. It was most obvious, despite his
calm, contained manner that he considered himself
needlessly affronted. “But like father, like daughter,”
Mrs. Annandale reflected, when Arabella,
without the scantiest notice of his aspect, once more
joined in the discussion.</p>

<p>“Now that is just how I think you show your knowledge
of men and opportunities, papa,” she remarked.
“A more experienced officer than Mr. Raymond—Mr.
Mervyn, for instance—would have turned
back and lost your opportunity, who knows for how
long, and the men would have been so demoralized
by relinquishing the march for a snow-storm that
they might not have made their way back even to
Fort Prince George—remember how sudden it was,
and how soon those nearest defiles were full of drifts.
A man can be snowed under in twenty miles of forest
as easily as in a hundred. But a young, ardent,
dreadnaught like Mr. Raymond will push the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
through by the sheer impetus of his own character.
His buoyant spirit will make the march a lark for
the whole command.”</p>

<p>Mervyn’s eyes widened as he listened in stultified
surprise. He was amazed at his lady-love’s
temerity, to thus suggest Raymond’s superiority to
him in aught. He sought to meet her eye with a gaze
of dignified reproof. But she was evidently not
thinking of him. In truth, Arabella’s heart was soft
with sympathy for the commandant, yearning after
his twenty odd hardened, harum-scarum young
soldiers, as if they were the babes in the wood.
He was afraid he had unduly exposed them to
danger, and in the thought no woman could have
been more troubled and tender,—in fact, for such
a cause his sister could never have been so softened,
so hysterically anxious.</p>

<p>“You are right, Arabella; Raymond has something
better than caution or judgment. He is pertinacious
and insistent, carries things before him,
won’t take no for an answer—he is a very good
fighting man, too.”</p>

<p>“But his lack of experience, sir,” Mervyn interpolated
with lifted eye-brows, “the very rank and
file comment on it. They call him ‘the hinfant,’
and ‘the babby ensign’!”</p>

<p>Captain Howard flushed scarlet.</p>

<p>“They are mighty careful that it doesn’t reach
his ears,” he said, sternly. “Ensign Raymond
knows how to maintain his dignity as well as any
man twice his age I ever saw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>“Oh, papa, he does!” cried Arabella, eagerly corroborative.
“I often notice when he is serious how
noble and thoughtful he looks.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale was not near enough to give her
niece a warning pinch; from such admonitions against
girlish candor Miss Howard’s delicate arm sometimes
showed blue tokens. Like Mervyn, but with a different
intent, the schemer tried to catch the young
lady’s eye. Now she felt she could no longer contain
her displeasure, and her anxiety lest the matter go
further than prudence might warrant impaired her
judgment.</p>

<p>“Dear me, Arabella,” she said, with an icy inflection,
“one would think you are in love with the
man.”</p>

<p>The obvious response for any girl was, in her opinion,
a confused denial, and this necessity would warn
Arabella how far in the heat of argument she was
going.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Annandale’s astonishment Arabella softly
laid the tambour-frame on her knee as if better
to contemplate the suggestion. She held the needle
motionless for an instant, her eyes on the fire, and
suddenly she said as if to herself:—</p>

<p>“Sometimes I, too, think I am in love with
him.”</p>

<p>Mervyn shot a furious glance at her, but she had
hardly looked at him all the evening, and she now
continued blandly unaware. If Captain Howard
marked what she had said it must have seemed a
jest, for he went on, magnifying Raymond’s capacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
to take care of himself and to bring his detachment
safely home.</p>

<p>Despite these arguments Captain Howard continued
ill at ease, watchful of the weather, anticipating
a renewal of snow or hopeful of tokens of
thaw; eager to confer with any stray Indian, who
Mervyn believed often came from no greater distance
than the town of Keowee across the river; comparing
reminiscences of distances and the situation of
sundry notable Indian towns with veterans of the
two campaigns during the previous years in the
Cherokee country. In addition to the information
of some of the garrison on this point, he was able to
glean items from the very intimate knowledge of
all that region possessed by the Reverend Mr.
Morton, now contentedly installed at Fort Prince
George, and holding forth at close intervals for the
soul’s health of the soldiery. But even he had a
thrust for the tender sensibilities of Captain Howard’s
military conscience.</p>

<p>“Ensign Raymond,” he said, apropos of the mooted
safe return of the expeditionary force, “is of a very
impetuous and imperious nature. God grant that
he be not hurried into any untoward and reckless
course. We can but pray for him, sir.”</p>

<p>“Gad! I ought to have prayed beforehand,” exclaimed
the commandant.</p>

<p>“And that is very true,” said the missionary.</p>

<p>But Captain Howard had not intended to be entrapped
into confession, and he found Mr. Morton
cheerless company in these days of suspense. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
it was his faithful belief that a proper disposition of
forces and munitions of war is calculated to induce
Providence to fight on one’s side and an omission of
these rules and precautions is wilful neglect of means
of grace. He saw little of the minister in these days,
but Mrs. Annandale professed herself vastly edified
by the good man’s discourse, and kept him
in conversation on one side of the fireplace
while the two young people were ranged upon the
other. Even the old man, inattentive to such
matters, fell under the impression that the young
lady and her cavalier seemed not a little disposed
to bicker, and one evening when their voices were
raised in spirited retort and counter-retort, Mrs.
Annandale took occasion to say to him behind the
waving feathers of her fan, that they were betrothed,
and that their lovers’ quarrels wearied her out of
all patience.</p>

<p>He inclined his head with its straggling wig, which
Rolloweh, with courteous compliments, had punctiliously
sent down from Little Tamotlee; in its shabby
similitude to the furnishings of humanity it had the
look of being of low spirits and maltreated, and as if
in its natural estate it might have been the hair of
some poor relation. Mr. Morton observed that he
hoped the young people were fully aware of the
transitory nature of earthly bliss.</p>

<p>“Oh, they know that fast enough—their snappings
and snarlings are a proof of its transitory nature, if
they had no other,” said Mrs. Annandale, sourly.</p>

<p>For Mervyn was not disposed to pass by, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
an explanation, Arabella’s statement that she sometimes
thought she was in love with Raymond.</p>

<p>“He is a presuming puppy!” declared Mervyn,
angrily, breathlessly, looking at her with indignant
eyes.</p>

<p>“I can’t see in what respect he presumes,” she
stipulated. “He has never said a word of love to
me.”</p>

<p>“But you said—”</p>

<p>“Only that I sometimes thought I was in love with
him.”</p>

<p>“You want to tantalize me—to make me miserable.
For my life I can’t see why.”</p>

<p>He fared better when he appealed only to her
generosity, for she realized that in his way he loved
her. She had begun to realize that she did not, that
she had never loved him, and was prone to remind
him that she had always stipulated that he must
consider nothing settled.</p>

<p>“She only wants to feel her power,” Mrs. Annandale
had reassured him.</p>

<p>“They tell me these Indians are cannibals on occasion,”
she said to herself, for there had come to be
no one in whom she could really confide. “I wish they
would eat Raymond—he would doubtless prove a
spicy morsel—and I really don’t see any other
means to dispose of him out of harm’s way.”</p>

<p>Mervyn found a melancholy satisfaction in the enforced
silence, when he could not upbraid nor Arabella
retort, as they sat side by side on the dreary snowy
Sundays in the mess-hall, where the garrison attended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
divine service. A drum mounted upon the table
reached the proper height of a prayer desk, and all
the benches and settees in the barracks, guard-house,
and officers’ quarters were laid under requisition to
furnish forth sittings for the force. Captain Howard
was duly wakeful during the long and labored homily,
although he felt in his secret soul that the most acceptable
portion of the service was concluded when
Arabella’s voice, soaring high above the soldiers’
chorus, had ceased to resound, sweet and indescribably
clear, and sunk into silence. Mervyn found the psalms
for the day for her, and they read and sang from the
same book. She wore, in deference to the character of
the occasion, her formal church attire, and he was reduced
to further abysses of subjection by the sight of
her lovely face and head, unfamiliar, and yet the same,
in such a bonnet as should have graced her attendance
at the parish church at home. A white beaver of
the poke or coal-scuttle form framed her golden hair,
and accented the flush in her cheeks and the warm
whiteness of brow and chin. Her ermine muff and
tippet were inconceivably reminiscent of home and
church-going. Her long black velvet pelisse gave
her an air of rich attire which enhanced her beauty
and elegance with the idea of rank and wealth which
it was to be his good fortune to bestow on her. Never
had she been so beautiful as with that look of staid
decorum, of solemnity and reverence. Captain
Howard might well have enjoyed his regular Sabbatical
nap—her attention was so sedulous it might have
sufficed for all the family. But he was noting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
manners of the garrison, and as they were conscious of
the commandant’s eye naught could have been more
seemly. Jerrold, and Innis, and Lawrence, themselves,
were not more reverential than Robin Dorn,
who raised the tune of psalm and hymn to the correct
pitch with a tuning fork, then piped away with a
high tenor, now and again essaying with good measure
of success a clear falsetto. The non-professional
tenors held to the normal register, the basses boomed
after their kind, and above all, it might seem an echo
from heaven, the clear soprano voice. The big fire
flashed, hardly so red as the mass of red coats in the
restricted limits of one room, ample though its size,
and its decorations of red and white feathers, of grotesque
paintings on buffalo hides, of flashing steel
arms and gaudy bows and quivers, all glimmered,
and gleamed, and flickered, and faded as the flames
rose and fell.</p>

<p>And the homily—it was not likely that the congregation
knew much about the significance of the
Pentateuchal types and analogies, but if the idea of
such crass ignorance could have occurred to Mr. Morton,
he would have said it was time they were finding
out somewhat. Perhaps as he drew near his sixthly
division and began to illustrate a similarity of the
religious customs of the Jews and Indians, they may
have pricked up their ears, and still more when he
deduced an analogy between the cruelty of the temper
of the ancient Hebrews toward their enemies and the
torture practised by the modern Indian. He cautioned
his hearers on the danger of prying into the religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
ceremonies of the Cherokees as if his audience shared
the pious fervor which consumed him, but said he did
not despair of using these similarities as an introduction
of the Christian religion, of which they were
a forerunner and type. Then he talked of the legends
of the lost tribes, till Captain Howard felt that it
would be a piety to fall on his own sword like the
military heroes of Scripture, world-weary. At last he
ended with:—</p>

<p>“‘Woe—woe is me if I preach not the Gospel!’”</p>

<p>“And—woe—woe, surely, is thy hearer!” Mrs.
Annandale mimicked below her breath, as hanging
on her brother’s arm she walked decorously across the
snowy parade to the commandant’s quarters. Mervyn
and Arabella followed in silence, the young
man’s thoughts on the ivy-clad church of Chesley
Parish, and the walk thence through the lush greenth
of the park to Mervyn Hall, with this same fair hand
laid lightly on his arm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ensign Raymond</span> was no polemic nor versed in the
Hebraic analogies rife at that day among those who
ascribed a Semitic origin to the American Indian and
sought to recognize in them the “lost tribes of Israel.”
When at last he set foot on the “ever-sacred” soil of
the city of refuge and opened his sealed orders, it
was less a resemblance to ancient Jewish customs that
appealed to him than an appreciation of the prudence
of his commander in choosing this site for the delivery
of his mission. For he had that to say to the head-men
of the Cherokee nation which elsewhere might
cost him his life. Here, however, at the horns of the
altar, had he, himself, been the shedder of blood, he
was safe. Here his blood could not be shed. He was
under the shadow of the “wings of peace.” The
“infinitely holy” environment protected him and his.</p>

<p>When he drew up his command and addressed the
soldiers, ordering them on no account to venture
beyond the limits of the “beloved town,” the amazement
and flouting ridicule on their florid Irish and
Cockney faces marked the difficulty which the ordinary
mind experiences in seeking to assimilate the
theories of eld. With the heady severity characteristic
of a very young officer, he replied to the nettling
surprise and negation in their facial expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“It may sound like a fool notion to you, but you
must remember that you are only a pack of zanies,
and don’t know a condemned thing but the goose-step.
They had this same sort of immunity ’way
back in the Bible times,”—he was himself a trifle
vague,—“cities of refuge, where, in the case of involuntary
manslaughter, the slayer might find protection,
and in this ‘old peaceable town’ of Choté
no hurt may be done even to a wilful man-slayer, no
blood may be shed here,—now, do you understand?”</p>

<p>The heads were all erect; the position was
the regulation “attention” with “eyes front,” but
so round were these eyes with amazement that “the
greasy red-sticks” had aught similar to customs
“’way back in the Bible times,” that the caustic young
commander was moved to add: “You are a set of
heathen, too, or you would have learned all that
long ago,—about holding to the horns of the altar,
as an effective defensive measure. Anyhow,” he
summed up, “if you choose to go off the ‘sacred soil’
and get yourselves slaughtered, you cannot say that
you have not been fairly warned. You will disobey
orders, you will be put under full stoppage of pay,
and—<i>your</i> bones will not be buried.”</p>

<p>The parade was dismissed and they marched away,
much marvelling at his strange discourse.</p>

<p>The allusion to their bones remained rankling in
his mind. For there was a fence of human bones at
Choté, very grievous for a British soldier to look upon,—a
trophy, a triumphal relic, of the massacre of the
British garrison of Fort Loudon after its capitulation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
It had been difficult for Raymond to control the
righteous wrath of his soldiers in the presence of this
ghastly mockery,—notwithstanding their scanty
number and the realization that any demonstration
would be but the sacrifice of their own lives the
moment they should quit the soil of immunity. The
assurance of their commander that he would report
the indignity to the government, when doubtless
some action would be taken, was necessary to avert
disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>Raymond, himself, had great ado to contend with
the storm of anger a-surge within his own breast when
the Cherokees ceremoniously received him, beating
the drums of the late Captain Demeré, who had
marched out of Fort Loudon with the full honors of
war, with flags and music and their assurance of
safeguard.</p>

<p>“This is not well,” Raymond could not refrain from
saying, as he stood in the centre of the “beloved
square” in the midst of the town, with the head-men,
splendidly arrayed in their barbaric fashion, gathered
to greet him. “The articles of capitulation reserved
to Captain Demeré the colors, drums, and arms
of the garrison—he had the solemn assurance of
the Cherokee nation,—and—” Raymond was very
young; his face turned scarlet, the tears stood in his
eyes, he caught his breath with something very like
a sob, “the remains of that honorable soldier are
entitled to Christian burial.”</p>

<p>He was sorry a moment later that he had said
aught. The Indians’ obvious relish of his distress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
was so keen. They replied diplomatically, however,
that all this had happened long ago, nearly three
years, in fact, and that if they had done aught amiss,
the British government had amply avenged the misdeed
in the distressful wars it had waged against the
Cherokee nation, that had indeed been reduced to the
extremity of humiliation.</p>

<p>Raymond, breathing a sigh of solace, was accepting
this logic with the docile rudimentary reasoning of
youth, when one of the chiefs, with a countenance at
once singularly fierce and acute, the great Oconostota,
added blandly that he, himself, had known Captain
Demeré with something of intimacy and desired to
withhold naught of advantage from him. If Ensign
Raymond was sufficiently acquainted with his bones
to select them from out the fence, he would be privileged
to remove them. But this applied to none of
the other bones, for the consent of other warriors
controlled the remainder of the structure.</p>

<p>When he paused a ripple of mirth, like a sudden
flash of lightning on a dull cloud, appeared on the
feather-crested faces and disappeared in an instant.
They all stolidly eyed Raymond, standing with his
hand on his sword, his heart swelling as he realized
the fleer with the ludicrous ghastliness of the dilemma
it presented. Then it was that Raymond showed
the soldier. The cub, despite its immaturity, has all
the inherent mettle of the lion. His eyes still flashed,
his cheek glowed, his voice shook, but he replied with
a suavity, which was itself a menace, that being only
a subaltern he did not feel authorized to take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
initiative in so serious a matter, but that he would
report the offer to Captain Howard, commanding at
Fort Prince George, with whom Oconostota was also
acquainted, and with, he believed, some degree of
intimacy.</p>

<p>That the Indians were adepts in every art of propitiation
was amply manifest in the urbanities that
Raymond enjoyed after this apt suggestion, and if
aught could have obliterated its provocation from
his mind, this would have been compassed by the
courtesies and attentions showered upon him and his
men during the days that intervened between his
arrival and the time when etiquette permitted the
business of his mission to be opened.</p>

<p>Raymond seemed to have brought the spring to
Choté, that lovely vernal expectation which holds a
charm hardly to be surpassed by the richness of
fulfilment. Soft languors were in the air, infinitely
luxurious. A large leisure seemed to pervade the
world. The trees budded slowly, slowly. At a distance
the forests had similitudes of leaflets, but as
yet the buds did not expand. It was evident that
the grass was freshly springing, for deer were visible
all a-graze on the opposite banks of the Tennessee
River. Far away the booming note of buffalo came
to the ear, and again was only a soft silence. A
silver haze hung in the ravines and chasms of the
mountains, austere, dark, leafless, close at hand but
in the distance wearing a delicate azure that might
have befitted a summer-tide scene.</p>

<p>After the long, toilsome, wintry march Raymond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
found a sort of luxury in this interval of rest, despite
the unaccustomed barbaric manners of his hosts.
He sought to make due allowance for the differing
standards of civilization, but there was much that was
irksome notwithstanding the utmost endeavors of his
entertainers to win his favor. From morning to
night he was attended by an obsequious young warrior
called “Wolf-with-two-feet” with half a dozen
braves who tried to anticipate his every wish, and
when he was relegated to his repose at night in the
“stranger house,” a guard was placed before the door
to protect the guest from intrusion or harm. Raymond
thought this cordon of braves was also effective
in preventing on his part any reconnoitring expedition
thence, when Choté, old town, lay asleep and at the
mercy of the curiosity of the inquisitive British
officer. This suspicion, however, seemed contradicted
by the disposition of his cicerone during the day. He
was dragged hither and thither over every inch of the
“sacred soil” as it appeared, and every object of
interest that the town possessed was paraded before
him to titillate his interest. The Indians of Choté,
an ancient and conservative municipality, yet retained
a certain pride in their national methods
despite the repeated demonstration of the superiority
of the Europeans both in war and manufactures.
Had Raymond possessed a theoretical interest in such
matters, or were he skilled in anthropological deductions,
he might have derived from them some information
concerning the forgotten history of the people.
But it was only with the superficial attention of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
desperately idle that he watched the great weaving-frame
on which they made their cloth, of porous
quality—few yards indeed now being produced since
the Indian trade had brought English textile fabrics
to the Tennessee River. He had never seen a better
saddle than the one a leisurely wight was finishing—lying
down in the sun at intervals and sleeping an
hour or so to reward some unusual speed of exertion.
Raymond committed the solecism of laughing aloud
when told that a year’s time was necessary to complete
a saddle to the satisfaction of the expert. He
took more interest in their pottery—a wonderfully
symmetrical pattern, in deep indentations in checks
or plaids, baffled his conjecture as to how it was applied
in the decoration of jars and bowls of the quaintest
shape imaginable. His guide, philosopher, and
friend challenged him to a dozen guesses, breaking
out in guttural glee and ridicule at every untoward
suggestion, till at last Raymond was shown the
baskets, deftly woven of splints or straw or withes,
which were lined with clay, and set to bake in the
oven, the plastic material taking not only the shape of
the mould but the pattern of the braiding.</p>

<p>Raymond thought it was his interest in this primitive
art that had defied his conjectures which influenced
his attention toward another plastic impression
different from aught he had seen in the Cherokee
country. Still accompanied by Wolf-with-two-feet
he had left the main portion of the town, and the
two were idly strolling along the river-bank. Raymond
was thinking that Wolf-with-two-feet was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
not a poor specimen of a host considering his
limitations, his strange, antiquated, savage standards,
and his incapacity for civilization in a modern sort.
He had kept the shuttle-cock of conversation tossing
back and forth for two days. He had gotten up a
horse-race and a feather-dance to entertain the guest.
He had fed him on his choice of an imitation of
British fare and appetizing Indian dainties, and of the
latter Raymond partook with distinct relish. He had
shown the town and descanted on the value of its
methods of government and its manufactures, and
save that now and again he turned his sharp, high-featured
face, with its polled head and feather crest,
toward him with a fiery eye, his upper lip suddenly
baring all his narrow white teeth set in a curiously
narrow arch, the officer could see naught of the wolf
in him.</p>

<p>The sky was beginning to redden; the air was
bland and filled with the scent of the spring-tide
herbs; some early growth of mint was crushed under
their feet and sent up a pungent aroma; the ground
was moist and warm, as it had been for several days;
Raymond noticed on the shelving shore the mark, still
distinct, of the prow of the canoe in which he had
landed at Choté,—for during the last stages of the
march the Indians of the various riverside towns of
the vicinity had come forth and proffered their boats
for the remainder of the journey. He now spoke of
the circumstance and identified the spot and the
canoe, for there was the print of his London-made
boot distinct amongst the tracks of a dozen Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
moccasins. His men had followed in a pettiaugre,
formerly belonging to Fort Loudon, and had landed
a little below the town.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this idle interest that kept him still
looking at the ground,—for, as they skirted a point
and came again on a marshy level beneath a row of
cliffs, he suddenly paused and pointed out a different
impression on the earth.</p>

<p>“But what is that?” he said, thinking first of some
queer fish or amphibious animal, for the natural history
of America was of vast interest to Europeans,
and there were many fables current of strange creatures
peculiar to the new world.</p>

<p>The Wolf-with-two-feet turned and looked down
at the spot at which Raymond was staring.</p>

<p>“Where?” he asked in Cherokee, for the British
officer spoke the language with enough facility to
enable them in casual conversation to dispense with
an interpreter.</p>

<p>The impression was of a deep indentation in the
centre, surrounded at the distance of some inches by
a ring, plainly marked but less deep, and this had an
outer circular imprint very symmetrical but still more
shallow. Raymond saw that for one moment the
eyes of the Indian rested upon it, but still saying,
“Where?” he stepped about, looking now in every
direction but the one indicated; all at once, as if inadvertently,
he pressed his foot deeply into the
marshy soil, and the water rushing up obliterated
forever the impression of the deep indentation and
the two concentric circles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>Raymond called out to him pettishly that he had
spoiled the opportunity of discovering the cause of
so strange a mark.</p>

<p>“’Twas the track of a snake, perhaps, or a tortoise,”
the Wolf suggested.</p>

<p>When he was assured that this was something
circular and symmetrical, he said he did not know
what it could have been, but some things had big
hoofs. Perhaps it might have been Mr. Morton’s Big
Devil, whom he was so fond of preaching about!</p>

<p>“In Choté?” asked Raymond.</p>

<p>“Oh no—not in Choté,” the Wolf made haste to
say—“Mr. Morton could not preach in Choté. Cunigacatgoah
has a sacred stone, an amulet, that belongs
to the Cherokee people, and it would not suffer a
word about Mr. Morton’s very wicked Big Devil in
the city of refuge.”</p>

<p>“An amulet against evil,” said Raymond sarcastically—“and
yet the Devil walks along the river-bank
of the ‘ever-sacred’ soil and leaves his big footprint
in defiance!”</p>

<p>“True,—true,”—said the Wolf, doubling like his
own prey, “then it couldn’t have been the Devil.
It must have been a buffalo,—just a big bull
buffalo.”</p>

<p>“A big bull buffalo with one foot,” sneered Raymond,
logically, “there is no other track near it,—except,”
he continued looking narrowly at the earth,
“the imprint of a number of moccasins of several
sizes.” He was merely irritated at the balking of
his natural curiosity, but he noticed with surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
that Wolf-with-two-feet was very eager to quit the
subject, and digressed with some skill and by an imperceptible
gradation from the character of this
spongy soil, so plastic to impressions, to the alluvial
richness of the whole belt along the watercourses and
thence to the large yield of the public fields that lay
to the southwest of Choté, and which were even now,
early as it was, in process of being planted. And then,
as if suddenly bethinking himself, he changed the
direction of their stroll to give Raymond an exhibition
of the primitive methods of agriculture practised
with such signal success at Choté Great. At
this hour the laborers had quitted the fields, leaving,
however, ample token of their industry. For in the
whole stretch of the cultivated land the fresh, rich,
black loam had been turned, but with never a plough,
and daily large numbers of women and girls repaired
thither under the guidance of the “second men” of
the town to drop the corn. Though the world was so
full of provender elsewhere, the birds took great account
of this proceeding, and thronged the air twittering
and chattering together as if discussing the
crop prospects. Now and again a bluejay flew across
the wide expanse of the fields, clanging a wild woodsy
cry with a peculiarly saucy intonation, as though to
say, “I’ll have my share! I’ll have my share!”</p>

<p>But birds were builders in these days, and he could
hardly see a beak that was not laden with a straw.
Oh, joyous architects, how benign that no foreknowledge
of the storm that was to wreck these frail
tenements, so craftily constructed, or of the marauder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
that was to rifle them, hushed the song or weighted
the wing! Human beings have a hard bargain in
their vaunted reason.</p>

<p>There was none of the delight in the spring; none
of the bliss of sheer existence in days so redundant of
soft sheen, of sweet sound, of fragrant winds, of the
stirring pulse of universal revivification; none of
that trust in the future which is itself the logic of
gratitude for the boons of the past, expressed in the
hard-bitten faces of the head-men and in the serious
eyes of the young officer when they sat in a circle
around the fire in the centre of the council-house at
Choté. They were all anxious, troubled, each determined
to mould the days to come after the fashion
of his individual will, only mindful enough of the will
of others to have a sense of doubt, of poignant hope,
and a strenuous realization of conflict. Thus the
young officer was wary, and the Indian chiefs were
even wilier than their wont as he opened the subject
of his mission.</p>

<p>The interpreter of each faction stood behind his
principal, for a long time silent as the official pipe
was smoked. The council-house of the usual type,
a great rotunda built on a high mound near the “beloved
square,” and plastered within and without with
red clay, was dark, save for the glimmer of the dull
fire and the high, narrow door, through which could
be seen the town of similar architecture but of smaller
edifices, with here and there a log cabin of the fashion
which the pioneers imitated in their earlier dwellings,
familiar to this day, and the open shed-like buildings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
at each side of the “beloved square.” The river was
in full view, a burnished steely gray, and the further
mountains delicately blue, but more than once, as
Raymond glanced toward them, his eyes were filled
with a blinding red glare, sudden, translucent, transitory.</p>

<p>Only the nerve of a strong man, young, hearty,
well-fed, enabled him to be still and make no sign.
The first thought in his mind was that this was a
premonition of illness, and hence it behooved him to
address himself swiftly to the business in hand that
no interest of the government might suffer. As he
pressed his palm to his brow for a moment, it occurred
to him that the strange feather-crested faces were
watching him curiously, inimically,—but perhaps
that was merely because they doubted the intent of
his mission.</p>

<p>And so in Choté, in the unbroken peace of its
traditional sanctity, he began with open hostility.</p>

<p>“You signed a treaty, Cunigacatgoah,” he addressed
the ancient chief, “and you Oconostota, and
other head-men for the whole Cherokee nation,—in
many things you have broken it.”</p>

<p>Several chiefs held out their hands to receive
“sticks,” that they might reply categorically to this
point when he had finished. But he shook his head.
He did not intend to conform to Indian etiquette
further than in sitting on a buffalo rug on the floor,
with his legs in their white breeches and leggings folded
up before him like the blades of a clasp knife. He
gesticulated much with his hands, around which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
best lace frills dangled, and he wore a dress sword as
a mark of ceremony; his hair was powdered, too, and
he carried his cocked hat in his left hand. He did
not intend to be rude, but he was determined to lose
no time in useless observances, because of that strange
affection, that curious red glare which had seemed to
suffuse his eyes, portending some disturbance of the
brain perchance.</p>

<p>“No,” he said firmly, declining to receive or to
give the notched sticks, “I am not going to enter into
the various details. There is only one thing out of
kilter about that treaty which I am going to settle.
It relates to the cannon which you brought here after
the capitulation of Fort Loudon. They were to be
delivered up to the British government according to
the last treaty. Eight of these guns were taken down
to Fort Prince George, one was burst by an overcharge
at Fort Loudon, but others you have not
relinquished. You have evaded compliance.”</p>

<p>A long silence ensued, while the chiefs gazed inscrutably
into the fire. Their pride, their dignity
suffered from this cavalier address. All their rancor
was aroused against this man,—even his callowness
was displeasing to them. They revolted at his incapacity
for ceremonial observance, save, indeed, such
as appertained to his military drill, which they esteemed
hideous and of no value to the British in the
supreme test of battle. They resented his persistence
in having ensconced himself here under the protection
of the sanctities of Choté until after his offensive
mission should be disclosed and answered. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
had evidently neither the will nor the art to disguise
it with euphemistic phraseology that might
render it more acceptable to a feint of consideration.
It was not now, however, at the moment of the
French withdrawal, that the Cherokees could resist
by force an English demand. Diplomacy must needs
therefore fill the breach. In some way Captain
Howard had evidently learned that the three missing
cannon were not sunk in the river by the garrison of
Fort Loudon as the Cherokees had declared. With
this thought in his mind, Cunigacatgoah said suddenly,
“Only three cannon failed to be relinquished,—they
had been in the river, and they were all sick,—they
could not speak.”</p>

<p>“Sick,—are they? I have a sovereign remedy
for a sick cannon,” declared Raymond. “They shall
speak and—” Once more as he glanced mechanically
through the open door toward the brilliant
outer world, with the gleam of the river below the
clifty mountains and a flight of swans above, that
curious translucent red light flashed through his eye-balls.</p>

<p>This time he was quicker,—or perhaps accident
favored him, for as, half-blinded, his glance returned,
he saw the red light disappearing into the ample
sleeve of one of the Indians who sat on the opposite
side of the fire.</p>

<p>Raymond’s first feeling was an infinite relief. No
illness menaced him, no obscure affection of the nerves
or brain. Some art of conjuring,—some mechanical
contrivance, was it?—they were employing to distract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
his attention. In their folly and fatuity did
they dream that they might thus undermine his purpose,
or weaken his intellect, or destroy his sight, or
work a spell upon him? He marked how they
watched his every motion.</p>

<p>He looked vaguely, uncertainly, about the shadowy
place, with its red wall. The decorated buffalo hides
suspended on it showed dully against its rich uniform
tint. The circle of the seated Indian chiefs in the
shifting shadow and the flickering light, with their
puerile ornaments of paint and feathers and strings
of worthless beads about the barbaric garb of skin
and fur, was itself vague, unreal, like a curious poly-tinted
daub, some extravagant depiction of aboriginal
art. Each face, however, was expressive in a different
degree of power, of perspicacity, of subtlety, and
many devious mental processes, and he marvelled, as
many wiser men have marvelled since, that these endowments
of value should fail to compass the essentials
of civilization, theorizing dimly that the Indians
were a remnant of a different order of being, the conclusion
of a period of human development, the final
expression of an alien mind, radically of an age and
species not to be repeated.</p>

<p>There was absolutely no basis of mutual comprehension,
and Raymond was definitely aware of this
when he said, “I can cure a disabled cannon,—show
me the guns,”—and a sudden silence ensued, the
demand evidently being wholly unexpected.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he urged, his patience growing scant,
“where are the guns now?” Then catching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
shifty expression of the chief, Cunigacatgoah, he was
moved to add, disregarding the interpreter, “<i>Gahusti
tsuskadi nigesuna.</i>” (You never tell a lie.)</p>

<p>Now and again his knowledge of the Cherokee
language had enabled him to detect the linguister for
the British force softening his downright candid
soldierly phrases. The interpreter was seeking to
mitigate the evident displeasure excited by the commander’s
address, which he thought might rebound
upon himself, as the medium of such unpleasant communication.
There was something so sarcastic in
this feigned compliment that it might well have seemed
positively unsafe, even more perilous than overt
insult, but as Raymond, with a wave of his cocked
hat in his left hand and a smiling bow of his heavily
powdered and becurled head, demanded, “<i>Haga tsunu
iyuta datsi waktuhi?</i>” (Tell me where they are now?)
a vague smile played over the features of Cunigacatgoah,
and he who was wont to believe so little, found
it easy to imagine himself implicitly believed, the
model of candor.</p>

<p>He instantly assumed an engaging appearance of
extreme frankness, and abruptly said, “Now, I, myself,
will tell you the whole truth.”</p>

<p>Raymond looked at him eagerly, breathlessly, full
of instant expectation.</p>

<p>“The cannon are not here,—they have all three
sickened and died.”</p>

<p>The soldier sat dumbfounded for a moment, realizing
that this was no figurative speech, that he was
expected to entirely believe this,—so low they rated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
the intelligence of the English! He experienced the
revolt of reason that seizes on the mind amidst the
grotesqueries of a dream. He had no words to combat
the follies of the proposition. Only with a sarcastic,
fleering laugh he cried aloud, “<i>Gahusti tsuskadi
nigesuna!</i>” (You never tell a lie.)</p>

<p>The next moment he felt choking. He was balked,
helpless, hopeless, at the end. He knew that Captain
Howard had anticipated no strategy. The savages
could not by force hold the guns in the teeth of the
British demand, and the commandant of Fort Prince
George had fancied that they would be yielded,
however reluctantly, on official summons. They
were necessary to Captain Howard, to complete his
account of the munitions of war intrusted to his
charge, upon being transferred from Fort Prince
George. And this was the result of Raymond’s
mission,—to return empty-handed, outwitted, to
fail egregiously in the conduct of an expedition in
which he had been graced with an independent command,—Raymond
was hot and cold by turns when
he thought of it! Yet the guns had disappeared, the
Indians craftily held their secret, the impossible
checks even martial ardor. Raymond, however,
was of the type of stubborn campaigner that dies
in the last ditch. The imminence of defeat had
quickened all his faculties.</p>

<p>“<i>Ha-nagwa dugihyali</i>” (I’ll make a search), he
blustered.</p>

<p>But the threat was met with sarcastic smiles, and
Cunigacatgoah said again with urgent candor,—“<i>Agiyahusa
cannon.</i>” (My cannon are dead.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>As Raymond hesitated, half distraught with anxiety
and eagerness, the red light suddenly flashed once
more through his eye-balls from its invisible source.
He was inherently and by profession a soldier, and
it was not of his nature nor his trade to receive a
thrust without an effort to return a counter-thrust.</p>

<p>“Hidden!” he cried suddenly, with eyes distended.
“Hidden!” he paused, gasping for effect. “I know
the spot,” he screamed wildly, springing to his feet;
for he had just remembered the peculiar track he had
noticed on soft ground near the river, and he now
bethought himself that only the trunnion of a dismounted
gun could have made an imprint such as
this. It suggested a recent removal and a buoyant
hope. “The cannon are in the ravine by the river.
I know it! I know it!”</p>

<p>In the confusion attendant upon this sudden outburst
they all rose turning hither and thither, awaiting
they hardly knew what in this untoward mystery
of divination or revelation. Making a bull-like rush
amongst them, actually through the fire, Raymond
fairly charged upon the conjurer, felling him to the
ground, and ran at full speed out into the air and
down the steep mound.</p>

<p>“Fall in! Fall in!” he cried out to his “zanies”
as he went, hearing in a moment the welcome sound
of his own drum beating “the assembly.”</p>

<p>He led the way to the locality where he had seen
the track, followed by all his score of men at a brisk
double-quick. In a ravine by the river a close
search resulted in the discovery of the guns ambushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
in a sort of grotto, all now mounted on their carriages.
Not so sick were they but that they could speak aloud,
and they shouted lustily when the charges of blank
cartridges issued from their smoking throats. For
the giddy young officer had them dragged up to the
bluffs and trained them upon the “beloved town”
of peace itself, and by reason of the Indians’ terror
of artillery hardly five minutes elapsed before Choté
was deserted by every inhabitant.</p>

<p>Raymond found his best capacity enlisted to maintain
his authority and prevent his twenty men
flushed with victory, triumphant and riotous with
joy, from pillaging the city of refuge, thus left helpless
at their mercy. But the behests of so high-handed
and impetuous a commander were not to
be trifled with, and the troops were soon embarked
in the large pettiaugre belonging to the British government,
which chanced to be lying abandoned at
the shore. In this they transported the three guns,
which they fired repeatedly as they rowed up the
Tennessee River, with the echoes bellowing after
all along the clifty banks and far through the dense
woods,—effectually discouraging pursuit.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> the recoil of the pieces did not sink the old
pettiaugre with all on board, to their imminent danger
of drowning in the tumultuous depths of the spring
floods, Captain Howard could never understand,
except on the principle that “Naught is never in
danger,” as he said bluffly, now that his anxiety was
satisfied. The heavy rainfall and the melting of the
snows had swollen the watercourses of the region to
such a degree that they had risen out of their deep,
rock-bound channels, and this enabled Raymond to
secure water-carriage for the guns the greater part
of the return journey. He had some hardships to
relate of a long portage across country when the
pack animals which had carried his supplies and ammunition
had been utilized as artillery horses, and
had drawn the guns along such devious ways as the
buffalo paths from one salt spring to another might
furnish. Then they had embarked on the Keowee,
and had come down with a rushing current, firing a
salute to Fort Prince George as they approached,
eliciting much responsive cheering from the garrison,
and creating more commotion than they were worth,
the commandant gruffly opined.</p>

<p>He hearkened with a doubtful mien to the ensign’s
report of the vicissitudes of the expedition, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
obviously of the opinion that the whole mission could
have been as well accomplished in a less melodramatic
and turbulent manner.</p>

<p>“I knew,” he said, “that the official demand for
the guns would anger the chiefs, for they have long
craved the possession of a few pieces of artillery, and
nothing in their hands could be so dangerous to the
security of the colonies. But I was sure that being
in Choté, you were safe, and that if you should find
it necessary to seize the guns they would protect
you against all odds on your march back to Fort
Prince George. I did not imagine the chiefs would
venture so far as to conceal the cannon, and of course
that gave you a point of great difficulty. But the
feint of firing on the town was altogether unnecessary.
There was no occasion for incivility.”</p>

<p>“Stop me, sir, if it had not been for their lies and
conjuring tricks I should have been as polite as
pie.”</p>

<p>Captain Howard listened with an impartial reservation
of opinion to the detail of the magic red light,
but his face changed as Raymond took from his
pocket a gem-like stone, large, translucent, darkly
red, and caught upon it an intense reflection from
the dull fire in the commandant’s office.</p>

<p>“This must be their famous ‘conjuring-stone,’”
he said gravely.</p>

<p>“The fellow dropped it when I knocked him down,”
Raymond explained, graphically. “I lost my balance,
and we rolled on the ground together, and as
I pulled loose I found this in my hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>Early travellers in this region describe this “conjuring-stone”
of the Cherokees as the size of a hen’s
egg, red and of a crystalline effect, like a ruby, but
with a beautiful dark shade in the centre, and capable
of an intense reflection of light.</p>

<p>The next day Captain Howard received from the
Indians the strange complaint that the British ensign
had their “religion,” with a demand that he be required
to return it. They stated that they had
searched all their country for the sacred amulet, and
they were convinced that he had possessed himself of
it. They were robbed of their “religion.”</p>

<p>“This is idolatry,” exclaimed the old missionary,
rancorously, vehement objection eloquent on his
face.</p>

<p>“They tried to put my eyes out with their ‘religion,’”
declared Raymond. “They shall not have
the amulet back again. They are better off without
such ‘religion.’”</p>

<p>“That is not for <i>you</i> to judge,” said Arabella,
staidly.</p>

<p>They were all strolling along the rampart within the
stockade after retreat. The parade was visible on one
side with sundry incidents of garrison life. The
posting of sentinels was in progress; a corporal was
going out with the relief, and the echo of their brisk
tramp came marching back from the rocks of the
river-bank; the guard, a glitter of scarlet and
steel, was paraded before the main gate. From the
long, dark, barrack building rose now and again the
snatch of a soldier’s song, and presently a chorus of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
laughter as some barrack wit regaled the leisure of
his comrades. The sunset light was reflected from
the glazed windows of the officers’ quarters; several
of the mess had already assembled in their hall to
pass the evening with such kill-time ingenuities as
were possible in the wilderness. Now and again an
absentee crossed the parade with some token of how
the day had been passed;—a string of mountain
trout justified the rod and reel of an angler, coming
in muddy and wet, and the envy of another soldier
meeting him; at the further end, toward the stables,
a subaltern was training a wild young horse for a
hurdle race, and kept up the leaping back and forth
till he “came a cropper,” and his sore bones
admonished him that he had had enough for one
day.</p>

<p>The air was soft and sweet; the Keowee River,
flush to its brim with the spring floods, sang a veritable
roundelay and vied with the birds. Sunset
seemed to have had scant homing monitions, for wings
were yet continually astir in the blue sky. All the
lovely wooded eminences close about the fort, and the
Oconee mountain, and the nearer of the great Joree
ranges, were delicately, ethereally green against the
clear amethystine tone of the mountain background.</p>

<p>And as if to fairly abash and surpass the spring,
this dark-eyed, fair-haired girl herself wore green,
of a dainty shadowy tint, and carried over one arm,
swinging by a brown ribbon, a wide-brimmed hat,
held basket-wise, and full of violets, while the wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
stirred her tresses to a deeper, richer glitter in the
sunset after-glow. For these violets Raymond had
rifled the woods for fifty miles as he came, and she
turned now and again to them with evident pleasure,
sometimes to handle a tuft especially perfect.</p>

<p>Despite his hopelessness, in view of the impression
he had received as to Mervyn’s place in her good
graces, Raymond set a special value on aught that
seemed to commend him. He had greatly enjoyed
the pose of a successful soldier, who had returned
from the accomplishment of a difficult and diplomatic
mission. He cared not a <i>sou marqué</i> for the
criticism of several of the other officers of the post
who opined that it was a new interpretation of the
idea of diplomacy to train cannon on commissioners
in session and bring off the subject of negotiation
amidst the thunders of artillery. He had felt that
it was enough that he was here again, all in one piece,
and so were the cannon,—and he had brought off,
too, it seemed, the “religion” of the Cherokees.
He experienced a sudden reaction from this satisfaction
when Arabella turned from the violets, and
pronounced him unfit to judge of the Indian’s
religion.</p>

<p>“Why not? I am as good a Christian as anybody,”
he averred.</p>

<p>Mervyn at this moment had a certain keenness
of aspect, as if he relished the prospect of a difference.
This eagerness might have suggested to Raymond,
but for his own theory on the subject, that the placid
understanding which seemed to him to subsist between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
Arabella and the captain-lieutenant was not
as perfect as he thought.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Morton paused, with his snuff-box
in his hand, to cast an admonitory glance upon
the young ensign.</p>

<p>“There is none good,—no, not one,” he said
rebukingly.</p>

<p>He solemnly refreshed his nose with the snuff,
although that feature seemed hardly receptive of
any sentiment of satisfaction, so long and thin it
was, so melancholy of aspect, giving the emphasis
of asceticism to his pallid, narrow face, and his near-sighted,
absent-minded blue eyes.</p>

<p>“I mean, of course, by ordinary standards, sir. I’m
as good a Christian as Mervyn, or Lawrence, here,
or Innis, or—or—the captain,” Raymond concluded,
with a glance of arch audacity at the commandant.</p>

<p>“Hoh!” said Captain Howard, hardly knowing
how to take this. He did not pretend to be a pious
man, but it savored of insubordination for a subaltern
to claim spiritual equality with the ranking officer.</p>

<p>“When we are most satisfied with our spiritual
condition we have greatest cause for dissatisfaction,”
declared the parson.</p>

<p>With his lean legs encased in thread-bare black
breeches and darned hose,—he had been irreverently
dubbed “Shanks” during the earlier days of his
stay at Fort Prince George,—his semi-ludicrous
aspect of cadaverous asceticism and sanctity, so
incongruous with the haphazard conditions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
frontier, it would have been difficult for a casual
observer to discern the reason of the sentiment of
respect which he seemed to command in the minds
of these gallant and bluff soldiers. Their arduous
experience of the hard facts of life and the continual
defiance of death had left them but scant appreciation
of the fine-spun sacerdotal theories and subtle divergencies
of doctrine in which Mr. Morton delighted.
Seldom did he open his oracular lips save to exploit
some lengthy prelection of rigid dogma or to deliver
the prompt rebuke to profanity or levity, which in
the deep gravity of his nature seemed to him of
synonymous signification. He might hardly have
noticed the subject of conversation of the party as
he walked by the commandant’s side along the rampart,
but for the word “religion.” He seemed to
be endowed with a separate sense for the apprehension
of aught appertaining to the theme that to him made
up all the interest of this world and the world to come.
Therefore he spoke without fear or favor. His
asceticism was not of a pleasing relish, and his rebukes
served in no wise to commend him. It was his fearlessness
in a different sense that had made his name
venerated. The rank and file could not have done
with rehearsing, with a gloating eye of mingled pride,
and derision, and pity, how he had driven the gospel
home on the Cherokees, in season and out, they being
at his mercy, for by the rigid etiquette of the Indians
they were forbidden to interrupt or break in upon
any discourse, however lengthy or unpalatable.
And how he had persisted, albeit his life was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
safe; and how the head-men had finally notified
Captain Howard; and how Captain Howard had
remonstrated in vain; and how at last Ensign Raymond
had had the old parson literally brought off in
the arms of two of their own command. It is to be
feared that it was neither learning nor saintliness
that so commended the old missionary to the garrison
of Fort Prince George.</p>

<p>Now it seemed that the Cherokees had lost their
own religion, if this amulet represented it, for by
their curious racial logic Raymond possessed its
symbol and therefore they no longer had the fact.</p>

<p>“It is a heathen notion that I have got their religion,”
protested Raymond. “They never had any
religion.”</p>

<p>“It is religion to them,” said Arabella. “Religion
is faith. Religion is a conviction of the soul.”</p>

<p>“True religion is a revelation to the mind direct
from God,” said Mr. Morton, didactically. “The
name doth not befit the hideous pagan follies of the
Indians.”</p>

<p>She did not feel qualified to argue; she only said
vaguely with a certain primness, in contrast with
her method of addressing the young men:—</p>

<p>“Faith always seems to me the function of the soul,
as reason is of the mind. You can believe an error,
but mistakes are not founded on reason.”</p>

<p>Then she asked him suddenly if the stress that the
Cherokees laid on this amulet did not remind him
of the attributes of the ark of the Hebrews and their
despair because of its capture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>“The ark was a type,—a type,” he declared,
looking off with unseeing eyes into the blue and roseate
sky and launching out into a dissertation on the
image and the reality, the prophecy and its fulfilment,
with many a digression to a cognate theme,
while Captain Howard affected to listen and went
over in his mind his quarter-master’s accounts, the
state of the armament of the fort, and the equipment
of the men, all having relation to the settling of his
affairs in quitting his command. The younger
people chatted in low voices under cover of the monologue,
it not being directly addressed to them.</p>

<p>They had slowly strolled along the rampart as they
talked, the two elderly men in the rear, the girl in
the centre, with her charming fair-haired beauty,
more ethereal because of that pervasive, tempered,
pearly light which just precedes the dusk, while the
young officers, in the foppery of their red coats, their
white breeches, their cocked hats, and powdered hair,
kept on either side. The party made their way out
from the dead salient of the angle, only to be defended
by the musketry of soldiers standing on the banquettes,
and ascended the rising ground to the terre-pleine,
where cannon were mounted <i>en barbette</i> to fire
above the parapet.</p>

<p>As Arabella noticed the great guns, standing a-tilt,
she said they reminded her of grim hounds holding
their muzzles up to send forth fierce howls of defiance.</p>

<p>“They can send forth something fiercer than howls,”
said Raymond, applausively. He was a very young
soldier, and thought mighty well of the little cannon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
Captain Howard, who had seen war on a fine scale
and was used to forts of commensurate armament,
could not repress a twinkle of the eye, although for
no consideration would he have said aught to put
the subaltern out of conceit with his little guns.</p>

<p>The other cannon were pointed through embrasures
beneath the parapet. One of them had been run
back on its chassis. She paused beside it, and stood
looking through the large aperture, languid, and silent,
and vaguely wistful, at the scene from a new point
of view.</p>

<p>As she lingered thus, all fair-haired in her faint
green dress, with her hat on her arm full of violets,
one hand on the silent cannon, she seemed herself
a type of spring, of some benison of peace, of some
grave and tender mediatrix.</p>

<p>The foam was aflash on the rapids of the Keowee
River; the sound of its rush was distinct in the stillness.
Now and again the lowing of cattle came
from some distant ranch of pioneer settlers. The
Indian town of Keowee on the opposite side of the
river was distinct to view, with its conical roofs and
its great rotunda on a high mound, all recognizable,
despite the reduction of size to the proportions of
the landscape of the distance. No wing was now
astir in the pallid, colorless sky. One might hardly
say whence the light emanated, for the sun was down,
the twilight sped, and yet the darkness had not
fallen. A sort of gentle clarity possessed the atmosphere.
She noted the line of the parapet of the
covered way, heretofore invisible because of the high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
stockade, and beyond still the slope of the glacis,
and there—</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> that?” she said, starting forward, peering
through the embrasure into the gathering gloom.
A dark object was visible just beyond the crest of
the glacis. It was without form, vague, opaque,
motionless, and of a consistency impossible to divine.</p>

<p>“Why,—the Indian priests or conjurers,” Mervyn
explained. “They have been there all day.”</p>

<p>“They are called the <i>cheerataghe</i>,—men possessed
of divine fire,” Raymond volunteered.</p>

<p>The captain-lieutenant somewhat resented the
amendment of his explanation. “They are the only
people in the world who believe that Raymond has
any religion of any sort.” He laughed with relish
and banteringly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that is funny, Mr. Mervyn?”
she demanded, her tone a trifle enigmatical. She
did not look at him as she still leaned with one hand
on the cannon, her hat full of violets depending from
her arm.</p>

<p>“Vastly amusing, sure,” declared Mervyn,—and
Ensign Innis laughed, too, in the full persuasion of
pleasing.</p>

<p>“I can’t see their feathers or bonnets,” she said.</p>

<p>“No,” explained Raymond, “they have their heads
covered with the cloth they weave, and they heap
ashes on the cloth.”</p>

<p>“Oh-h-h!” cried out Arabella.</p>

<p>“Watch them,—watch them now,” Raymond
said quickly. “They are heaping the ashes on their
heads again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>There was a strange, undulatory motion among
the row of heavily draped figures, each bending to
the right, their hands seeming to wildly wave as they
caught up the invisible ashes before them and strewed
them over their heads, while a low wail broke forth.
“And you think this is funny?” demanded Arabella
of the young men, looking at them severally.</p>

<p>“I can’t say I think it is <i>un</i>funny,” said Innis,
with a rollicking laugh.</p>

<p>“I think it is very foolish,” said Lawrence.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they have lost a religion because
I’ve got it in my pocket,” said Raymond.</p>

<p>“And they are old men—are they?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Old?”—said Mervyn. “Old as Noah.”</p>

<p>“And they have had a long journey?”</p>

<p>“Pounded down here all the way from Choté on
their ten old toes.”</p>

<p>“And how long will they stay there, fasting, and
praying, and wailing, and waiting, in sackcloth and
ashes?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps till they work some sort of spell on me,”
suggested Raymond. She laughed at this in ridicule.</p>

<p>“Till the fort is evacuated, I suppose,” said Mervyn.</p>

<p>“So long as that!” she exclaimed, growing serious.
All at once she caught her breath with a gasp, staring
at the Indians in the gathering gloom, as with a
sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>“I would speak with them!—Oh, la!—what
a thing to tell in England! Take me down there,—quick.
Tillie vallie!—there is no water in the fosse.
What a brag to make in Kent! There can be no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
danger under the guns of the fort. Lord, papa,—<i>let
me go</i>!”</p>

<p>Captain Howard hesitated, but made no demur.
The war was over, and there was indeed no risk;
and Arabella’s pilgrimage into primeval realms
would be infinitely embellished by this freak. All
of the young officers accompanied her, the interpreter,
hastily summoned, following; the commandant
and the parson watched from the
rampart.</p>

<p>She went through the gray dusk like some translucent
apparition, the figment of lines of light. The
moon, now in the sky, hardly annulled the tints of
her faint green gown; her hair glittered in the sheen;
her face was ethereally white.</p>

<p>The wailing ceased as her advance was observed.
The swaying figures were still. A vague fear seized
her as she came near to those mysterious veiled creatures,
literally abased to the ground. She wavered
for a moment,—then she paused on the crest of the
glacis in silence and evident doubt.</p>

<p>There was an interval of suspense. The odors of
violets and dust and ashes were blended on the air.
Dew was falling; the river sang; and the moon shone
brighter as the darkness gathered.</p>

<p>“Good people,” she said, with a sort of agitated,
hysteric break in her clear voice, for she was realizing
that she knew not how to address magnates and
priests of a strange alien nation.</p>

<p>The croak of the interpreter came with a harsh
promptitude on each clause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>“Good people, I hear a voice,”—she paused again,
and corrected her phrase,—“I feel a monition—to
tell you that your prayers are answered. Your
‘religion’ I have the power to restore. To-morrow,
at the fort, at high noon, it shall be returned to you.
If you help the helpless, and feed the hungry, and
cherish the aged, and show mercy to captives, it will
be a better religion than ever heretofore. I promise,—I
pledge my word.”</p>

<p>She wavered anew and shrank back so suddenly
that Raymond thought she might fall. But no!
She fled like a deer, her green draperies all fluttering
in the wind, the moonlight on her golden hair and in
her shining eyes. The officers followed, half bewildered
by her freak, Raymond first of all. He overtook her
as she was climbing through the fraise of the steep
exterior slope of the rampart, clutching at the sharp
stakes to help her ascent.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” he said, catching at her sleeve and
pausing to look up gravely into her eyes as she, laughing,
gasping, half-hysterical, looked down at him
standing on the berme below. “Are you in earnest?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes,—yes,—I shall give back the amulet.”</p>

<p>She seemed hardly to realize that it was his;
that he had captured it in a mêlée; that it was now
in his possession; that he had a word in the matter,
a will to be consulted.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand—” he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Oh,—la,—<i>you</i>! You make no difference. <i>I</i>
have worked a spell on <i>you</i>,—as you know!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>She laughed again, caught her breath with a gasp,
and began once more to ascend swiftly through the
fraise. But he was beside her in a moment. He
caught her little hand trembling and cold in his.</p>

<p>“Arabella,” he cried, in agitated delight, “you
know I worship you,—you know that you have indeed
all my heart,—but only a subaltern,—I hardly
dared to hope—”</p>

<p>“La! you needn’t bestir yourself to hope now!
Sure, I didn’t say <i>you</i> had worked any spell on <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>Not another word was possible to him, for the others
had overtaken them, and it was in a twitter of laughter
that she climbed through the embrasure, and in
a flutter of delighted achievement that she breathlessly
detailed the adventure to her father and the
parson. Then hanging on the commandant’s arm she
demurely paced to and fro along the moonlit rampart,
now and again meeting Raymond’s gaze with
a coquettish air of bravado which seemed to say:—</p>

<p>“Talk love to me <i>now</i>,—if you dare!”</p>

<p>The embassy of Indians had disappeared like
magic. The party from the fort declared that upon
glancing back at the glacis the row of veiled, humiliated
figures had vanished in the inappreciable interval
of time like a wreath of mist or a puff of dust.</p>

<p>One could hardly say that they returned the next
day,—so unlike, so far alien to the aspect of the
humble mourners, who had wept and gnashed their
teeth and wailed in sackcloth and ashes on the glacis
of the fort in the dim dusk, was the splendidly armed
and arrayed delegation that high noon ushered into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
the main gate. Their coronets of white swan’s
feathers, standing fifteen inches high, with long
pendants trailing at the back, rose out of a soft band
of swan’s-down close on the forehead. They wore
wide collars or capes of the same material, and the
intense whiteness heightened the brilliancy of the
blotches of decorative paint with which their faces
were mottled. Each had a feather-wrought mantle
of iridescent plumage, the objects of textile beauty
so often described by travellers of that date. They
bore the arms of eld, in lieu of the more effective
musket, wearing them as ornaments and to emphasize
the fact that they were needed neither for defence
nor aggression. The bows and arrows were tipped
with quartz wrought to a fine polish, and the quivers
were covered with gorgeous embroidery of beads and
quills. Their hunting shirts and leggings were similarly
decorated and fringed with tinkling shells.
They were shod with the white buskins cabalistically
marked with red to indicate their calling and rank
as “beloved men.” Their number was the mystic
seven. They were all old, one obviously so infirm
that the pace of the others was retarded to permit
him to keep in company. They advanced with much
stateliness, and it was evidently an occasion of great
moment in their estimation.</p>

<p>Captain Howard, adopting the policy of the government
to fall in with the Indian ceremonial rather than
to seek to force the tribes to other methods, met them
in person, and with some pomp and circumstance
conducted them to the mess-hall in one of the block-houses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
as the most pretentious apartment of the fort.
He was an indulgent man when off duty. He was
rather glad, since to his surprise Ensign Raymond had
suddenly declared that he was willing to return the
amulet, that the Indians should have the bauble on
which they set so much value, and he was altogether
unmoved by Mr. Morton’s remonstrance that it was
a bargaining with Satan, a recognition of a pagan
worship, and a promotion of witchcraft and conjure
work to connive at the restoration of the red stone
to its purpose of delusion.</p>

<p>Inclination fosters an ingenuity of logic. “I am
disposed to think the stone is a symbol—a type of
something I do not understand,” Captain Howard
replied; evidently he had absorbed something of Mr.
Morton’s prelections by the sheer force of propinquity,
for certainly he had never intentionally hearkened to
them. “You, yourself, have often said the Cherokees
are in no sense idolaters.”</p>

<p>The officers of the post had no scruples. They
were all present, grouped about the walls, welcoming
aught that served to break the monotony. Mrs.
Annandale, cynical, inquisitive, scornful, and deeply
interested, was seated in one of the great chairs so
placed that she could not fail to see all of what she
contemptuously designated as “the antics.” Norah
stood behind her, wide-eyed and half-frightened,
gazing in breathless amazement at the proceedings.
The room was lighted only by the loop-holes for
musketry, looking to the outer sides of the bastion,
and the broadly flaring door, for there was no fire this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
warm, spring day. The great chimney-place was filled
with masses of pine boughs and glossy magnolia
leaves, to hide its sooty aperture, and on the wide
hearth, near this improvised bower, stood Arabella,
looking on, a pleased spectator, as Raymond advanced
to the table in the centre of the floor, and laid
upon it the great red stone, which shone in the shadowy
place with a translucent lustre that might
well justify its supernatural repute. The interpreter
repeated the courteous phrases in which Ensign
Raymond stated that he took pleasure in returning
this object of beauty and value which had by accident
fallen into his possession.</p>

<p>His words were received in dead silence. The
Indians absolutely ignored him. They looked through
him, beyond him, never at him. He had been the
cause of much anguish of soul, and the impulse of
forgiveness is foreign to such generosity of spirit as
is predicable of the savage.</p>

<p>A moment of suspense ensued. Then the tallest,
the stateliest of the Indians reached forth his hand,
took the amulet, passed it to a colleague, who in his
turn passed it to another, and in the continual transfer
its trail was lost and the keenest observer could not
say at length who was the custodian of the treasure.</p>

<p>Another moment of blank expectancy. There
were always these barren intervals in the leisurely
progress of Indian diplomacy. The interview seemed
at an end. The next incident might be the silent
filing out of the embassy and their swift, noiseless
departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>Suddenly the leader took from one of the others
a small bowl of their curious pottery. It was full
of fragrant green herbs which had been drenched in
clear water, for as he held them up the crystal drops
fell from them. There was a hush of amazed expectancy
as he advanced toward the young lady. With
an inspired mien and a sonorous voice he cried, casting
up his eyes, “<i>Higayuli Tsunega!</i>”</p>

<p>“Oh, supreme white Fire!” echoed the interpreter.</p>

<p>“<i>Sakani udunuhi nigesuna usinuliyu! Yu!</i>”</p>

<p>“Grant that she may never become unhappy! Yu!”</p>

<p>Then lifting the fresh leafage aloft, the cheerataghe,
with a solemn gesture, sprinkled the water into her
astounded face.</p>

<p>“Safe! Safe!” the interpreter continued to translate
his words. “Safe forever! She and hers can
never know harm in the land of the Cherokee. Not
even a spirit of the air may molest her; no ghost of
the departed may haunt her sleep; not the shadow of
a bird can fall upon her; no vagrant witch can touch
her with malign influence.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ha-usinuli nagwa ditsakuni denatlu hisaniga uy-igawasti
dudanti!</i>” declared the cheerataghe.</p>

<p>“We have keenly aimed our arrows against the
accursed wanderers of darkness!” chanted the interpreter.</p>

<p>“<i>Nigagi! Nigagi!</i>”</p>

<p>“Amen! Amen!”</p>

<p>A breathless silence ensued. No word. No stir.
The amazement depicted on the faces of the staring
officers, the dubitation intimated in Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
Howard’s corrugated, bushy eye-brows, the perplexity
in Mrs. Annandale’s eagerly observant, meagre little
countenance, were as definite a comment as if voiced
in words. This was all caviare indeed to their habits
of mind, accustomed as they were to the consideration
of material interests and the antagonisms of flesh
and blood. But the pale ascetic face of the old
missionary was kindled with a responsive glow that
was like the shining of a flame through an alabaster
vase, so pure, so exalted, so vivid an illumination it
expressed, so perfect a comprehension this spark
of symbolism had ignited.</p>

<p>As a type of covenant the suggestions afforded by
this incident occupied several learned pages of Mr.
Morton’s recondite work on “Baptism in its Various
Forms in Antient and Modern Times,” published some
years afterward, a subject which gratefully repays
amplification and is susceptible of infinite speculation.
The peculiar interest which the occasion developed
for him served to annul the qualms of
conscience which he had suffered, despite which, however,
instigated by the old Adam of curiosity, he had
permitted himself to be present at the restoration of
the conjuring-stone to its mission of delusion.</p>

<p>A mention of the amulet as a “lost religion” was
the next moment on the lips of the interpreter,
echoing the rhetorical periods of Yachtino, the chief
of Chilhowee, who had stepped forward and was
speaking with a forceful dignity of gesture and
the highly aspirated, greatly diversified intonations
of the Cherokee language, illustrating its vaunted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
capacity for eloquent expressiveness, and affording
the group a signal opportunity of judging of the
grace of oratory for which these Indians were then
famous.</p>

<p>The gratitude of the Indians, the spokesman declared,
was not to be measured by gifts. Not in
recognition of her beneficence, not in return for her
kindness,—for kindness cannot be bought or repaid,
and they were her debtors forever,—but as a matter
of barter the Cherokee nation bestowed upon her their
pearl, the “sleeping sun,” in exchange for the amulet
which she had caused to be returned by the ruthless
soldier.</p>

<p>Forthwith the chief of Chilhowee laid upon the table
the beautiful fresh-water pearl which Raymond had
seen at Cowetchee.</p>

<p>Heedless of all the subtler significance of the ceremony,
and, under the British flag, caring naught for
the vaunted puissance of Cherokee protection against
the seen and the unseen, the astonished and delighted
young beauty gazed speechless after the embassy, for
their grotesquely splendid figures had disappeared
as silently as the images of a dream, feeling that the
reward was altogether out of proportion with the
simplicity of the kindly impulse that had actuated
her girlish heart. Because they were very old and
savage, and, as she thought, very poor, and were
agonized for a boon which in their ignorance they
craved as dear and sacred, she had exerted the influence
she knew she possessed to restore to them
this trifle, this bauble,—and here in her hand the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
tear of compassion, as it were, was metamorphosed
into a gem such as she had never before beheld.</p>

<p>Mounted by a London jeweller between prongs set
with diamonds it was famous in her circle for its
size and beauty, and regarded as a curio it could out-vie
all Kent. She long remembered the Cherokee
words which described it, and she entertained a sort
of regretful reminiscence of Fort Prince George, soon
dismantled and fallen into decay, where the spring
had come so laden with beauty and charm, and with
incidents of such strange interest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Annandale also remembered it regretfully,
and with a bitter, oft-reiterated wish that Arabella
had never seen the little stronghold or the officers of
its garrison. She used her utmost endeavors against
Raymond’s suit, but threats, persuasion, appeals,
were vain with Arabella. She had made her choice,
and she would not depart from it. Her heart was
fixed, and not even the reproach to which her generous
temper rendered her most susceptible,—that
she had caused pain and unhappiness to Mervyn, encouraging
him to cherish unfounded hopes,—moved
her in the least. She reminded them both that she
had warned him he must not presume on her qualified
assent as a finality; she had always feared she
did not love him, and now she knew it was impossible.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine how Ensign Raymond had the
opportunity to interfere,” Mrs. Annandale said
wofully to her brother in one of their many conferences
on the unexpected turn of the romance the
match-maker had fostered. “I am sure I never gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
him the opportunity to make love to her; it was dishonorable
in him to introduce the subject of love
when he knew of her engagement.”</p>

<p>“He did not introduce the subject of love,” said
Arabella, remembering the scene in the fraise above
the scarp, and laughing shyly. “I, myself, spoke
first of love.”</p>

<p>Then awed by her aunt’s expression of horror and
offended propriety, she added demurely:—</p>

<p>“It must have been the influence of that amulet.
He had it then. They say it bestows on its possessor
his own best good.”</p>

<p>Captain Howard also remembered Fort Prince
George regretfully, and also with a vague wish that she
had never seen the little stronghold. He was not
exactly discontented with Raymond as a son-in-law,
but this was not his preference, for he had advocated
her acceptance of Mervyn’s suit. His own limited
patrimony lay adjoining the Mervyn estate, and he
thought the propinquity a mutual advantage to the
prospects of the two young people, and that it
materially enhanced Arabella’s position as a suitable
match for the Mervyn heir. The succeeding baronet
was a steady conventional fellow, and had been very
well thought of in the regiment before he sold out
upon coming into his title and fortune. Raymond
would be obliged to stick to the army, having but
small means, and he would doubtless do well if he
could be kept within bounds.</p>

<p>“But,” Captain Howard qualified, describing the
absent soldier to an intimate friend and country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
neighbor in Kent, over the post-prandial wine and
walnuts,—“but he is such a frisky dare-devil!
If he could be scared half to death by somebody it
would tame him, and be the making of him.”</p>

<p>In a few years it might have seemed that this had
been compassed, for it was said that Raymond was
afraid of his lovely wife. He was obviously so solicitous
of her approval, he considered her judgment of
such peculiar worth, and he thought her so “monstrous
clever,” that when impervious to all other
admonitions, he could be reached, advised, warned,
through her influence.</p>

<p>When he became a personage of note, for in those
days of many wars he soon rose to eminence, and it
was desired to flatter, or court, or conciliate him,
a difficult feat, for he was absolutely without vanity
for his own sake, it was understood that there was
one secure road to his favorable consideration,—he
was never insensible to admiration of his wife’s
linguistic accomplishments, which included among
more useful tongues, the unique acquisition of something
of the Cherokee language. Then, too, he was
always attentive and softened by any comment, in
some intimate coterie, upon the jewel, now called
a pendant, which, hanging by a slender chain, rose and
fell on a bosom as delicately white as the gem itself.
The great pearl was associated with the most cherished
sentiments of his life, his love and his pride in his professional
career,—with the inauguration of his dear
and lasting romance, and his first independent command.
With a tender reminiscent smile on his war-worn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
face, he would ask her to repeat the word for the
moon in the several dialects, and would listen with
an unwearied ear as she rehearsed her spirited story
of the “sleeping sun,” and the method of its barter
for the amulet.</p>

It reminds one, too, of Margaret Deland’s admirable ‘Old Chester Tales,’

With what a sense of humor, with what a delicacy of touch, with
what a finished skill Owen Wister has made an exquisite picture you must

<p>The author of “The Garden of a Commuter’s Wife” has returned
to her first theme; and those who revelled in that book will welcome
the outdoor volume promised for this spring under the intimate title
of “The Garden, You, and I.” Herein is the wholesome flow of good-humor
and keen observation that have always been among the charms
of “Barbara’s” writings.</p>

Before her opens the possibility of a brief life of intense joy with a
samurai pledged to the great red death for the emperor; this brief life, if
she takes it, must be bought with an eternity of pain.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
